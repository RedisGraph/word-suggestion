my take on new rule - doesn't go far enough. cup drivers will still dominate nxs. but happy they are out for chase races #smallvictories

white girls singing about "niggers" stealing shouldn't have had to face any repercussions? .....
nope bc evidently it was 1) a famous vine they repeated 2) there was no malicious intent 3) it was all freaking jokes
they're not 5 year olds. them repeating what they heard isn't an excuse. it does not matter if there was malicious intent.
of every race say that word all the time to their friends. there should've been no repercussions, if there had to be then

it's definitely a nervous habit i've had since forever and i just can't ever stop myself like the minute i see them

lol i came third still got a medal
bronze is in this season



great day to compete... stop protecting your youth from the harsh truth in the world. protect them from the comfortable lies.. #staypositive
perfect!  "comfortable lies" it takes a dad to do that, moms hide children from harshness more often. "protection mode always on
takes people searching the truth in everything. history, the gods you follow, holidays you celebrate, and perception vs reality
the god i follow is a big g not a little g the little g i followed (money, power, selfishness etc..) before the big jesus came.

no because she has 30 years of political baggage, lots of complex relationships/conflicts, and a serious email problem...
the 'baggage' is all from a relentless misogynistic cottage witch hunt industry press freely regurgitates. it's a gauntlet
she was cleared by doj/fbi on emails and the private personal ones stolen by a hostile foreign state aren't even her emails

i watched "hate rising" last night. highly recommended. the corridor scene with ramos and the trump camaign says it all. #nevertrump
i dvred it. haven't finished watching it yet. was at the point where he was interviewing the second guy.
the weirdo nazi groups are as expected - it's the people who might pass for normal who are shocking.
cloak the racism in "white nationalism" and all of a sudden it becomes a lot more palpable.



did you hear about the latest bloomberg poll from florida? how anyone can see that man as fit for the office... crazy!
wow! trump+2! on one hand this is bad. on the other hand it's good because it'll make people go vote!
that's a good point, i hope you are correct. hard to understand how we have to keep debating the case against trump.
the man has insulted and discriminated against the disabled, races, religions, nationalities, women! send him to washington!

and i missed it!! been dealing with a different kind of panicky state - press the button and i'm hopping!!

my goal: to watch an episode of #thisisus without weeping uncontrollably. my hunch: it will not happen.
damn, i started crying when randall was making a shake in the first minutes. went downhill from there. 
i'd say next week would be different but i already cried at the trailer. "i don't want to be different" #thisisus
i am hoping what i think i saw for next week is wrong. i love william. can't even think about it.



yall just gotta let the game speak for itself
best tweet i've seen all night
real easy to talk comes down to who's actually about it

i can't believe the legit trash that snapchat is allowed to post. if my kids had snapchat i would not want them able to see this garbage.
you talking the sponsored snap stories?
yussss
yeah seems very desperate:/



haven't we just come to accept tyrod being a game manager? knowing he doesn't really have any of his weapons
is it really fair to cast judgement on some of these passes that he's making at this point because he doesn't have
many options
you just want to see him make plays with what he has. but he hasn't. it's troubling



thank you to everyone who is concerned, but i am watching ever pitch so i don't need your constant texts, snaps, and updates. #gocubsgo
i'm sorry i didn't snap you. i'm still concerned for you, just simply forgot. #flythel
in every way possible
well obivi



also need to find some peeps who play cod. been saying that as well lol. miss having a 6man team. #cod4
i miss having a four man snd group, does anyone still play cod? has it been put to rest. held x to pay respects? #cod4revivial
80% of ppl i've played with vanished. some reason finding ppl to play with is harder then i thought.i underestimated the quest
but then again cod is slowly dying out and other games are sliding in. devs think we need crazy shit to be content. #wrong



just finished the last episode of that 70s show! now what am i going to do with my life??

fourth, qpf amount. think 1-2" covers it. could see a few higher amounts midcoast w/secondary low. slightly lower amts possible n mountains.
that should put a nail in the drought for many locations. precip still below normal but not drought level i'd think.
sadly not. we'd need the next 2-3 months to replenish all the water. 3yr deficits 12"+. a step in the right direction though!
3 year deficit? not in my part of maine. i'm not aware of any part of maine in a 3 year drought. it's well less than a year here

well, expect a lot more tears after we end up in more endless wars.
did my part in halliburton's war. still, #hereiamwithher. says a lot : my support is not just about her gender.
i didn't like that war either....she's a george bush in a pantsuit.

smoking hot white model in fake glasses. "she's average! look at her glasses! who couldn't relate to her"-secret deodorant. #closethewagegap
that's foolish. glasses make every girl 15% hotter
funny. it makes guys 75% hotter.
shit. i gotta stare at the sun. daddy's gone turn 2 a dam 7



i put a lot of thought into my latest instagram caption not gonna lie

it's getting boring



is sword art online 2 worth watching
meh. sao 1 was better. it's a lot more real world than virtual for kirito. not a huge fan.
lame. i'm more into the virtual world part of sao.
yeah me too. sao 2 is based in ggo (gun gale). when he's in that it's dope but there wayyy more real world than i'd liked.



joe scarborough looking for every single shred of evidence to support the idea that trump isn't going to get railroaded in 2 weeks.
this has been one of the most annoyingly frustrating things to watch the past few weeks.
i get it, it's a show and he needs to maintain his persona, but get real dude. his path to 270 is harder than a rubik's cube.
i like joe, most of the time, i like the show a lot, i get frustrated with both him and mika at times, but they do a good job



my last draw meet w/kids: this 15 year old girl looked through my iphone texts right in front of my friend....like bruh u dont do that....
what the... that's so rude and creepy???
it was so......creepy and the whole time she was trying to get my attention but in a very wrong way
:-( hopefully w age restriction it'll be less creepy?? like wowowow that was so invasive and over the line



where was #rudygiuliani the past few years....under a stone? he doesnt know anything, what he knows is what #donaldtrump told him
nohe knows what anyone can see. is she so specialyou would have been locked up for just one of her wrongdoings #truthmatrs
maybe in russia, turkey, north korea and others. where i come from, #donaldtrump could never run for anything the way he is
who are we talking aboutchris cuomo w/rjuliano or trump because i can talk to you about either #truthmatrs



let's hear about how the warriors game was rigged tonight!
dude, seriously, leave her alone.

i don't get it
if someone gets proposed to during my wedding

watching gowdy , jordan, chaffetz &amp; others spank that a**, truth wise
the last rivets in a sinking ship trying to hold this thing together
i don't think you should talk to a guy with the username francis marion about sinking ships :)
i may miss the jk, if that's how it was meant,infer he was in a ship wreck?if meant n a crass way,what shld i b thnkn about

y'all ever heard of the movie teeth?
yes! i watched that a few months ago. 
dude that shit is wild
inspect that shit first 



i'm on a pretty good streak of actually watching movies now - 3 nights in a row. no country for old men, steve jobs, &amp; there will be blood.
now someone give me a recommendation for a newer movie to watch tomorrow night, gotta keep the pattern going. old new old new.
watch all the other coen brother's movies you haven't seen.
still haven't seen hail, caesar. i've seen most of the rest but have a few old ones left



just saw a facebook interaction where a guy from brooklyn got actually g checked for never owning timberlands or a yankees fitted

i cannot stop laughing reading these tweets lol
like i shouldn't be mad but i am... i said husband on phone like 5x... obviously i can't be on my bf loan. i'm not retarded

happy birthday rose hope you have a fun day.
thanks! plan to lunch with best friend and have lots of girly talks 
sounds like fun.



that doesn't mean i'm ignoring the fact the duplicate rate was way too high.there needs to be an element of dupe prevention for ev sales.
i love the festival. it's the pay+rng that sucks! at least the dupes give silver...
silver dust for dupes isn't good enough imo, if someone spends 40 bucks, they should get the whole collection of cosmetic items.
i absolutely agree. but i guess that's all we get for a silver lining. 



so all of a sudden it's fucking winter today?? okay. fine.
girl it's cold but not winter cold.
it was a stupid wind storm when i left my cozy 75 degree home, winter enough for me!!
hahaha. you going to uzi next week?

tomato sauce makes spaghetti taste really good.
no greater fact based truth has ever been revealed on twitter.



do not buy into the conventions about mpb - it is just a bromide for those who are incapable of pulling it off.



"what are you going as for halloween?""a sexy blt"
what does that even mean?
bacon. lettuce. tomato.
much sass  i was just confused on the sexy part

i swear it took forever for mine to come in. i wanted the jet black but that wouldn't come in till almost  #nope 



hi fellow white people, newt's hateful behavior last night doesn't make megyn kelly less racist. lavishing her with praise is disrespectful.
if trump didn't insult her last year, do you think she'd really be anti-trump? i honestly question her motivation
it just doesn't sync up with her typical opinions and behavior as a person
no, she's definitely a garbage racist.



it's crazy how modern presidents have this kind of celebrity status among society now
they are now literally like puppets of the country, just for show
idk i don't see them as "puppets for show", but they do have that sense of publicity you know? the famous kind of publicity
yeah



my work calendar got cleared for the whole week b/c of an ask from senior management to design a presentation slideshow for our shareholders

hey howie...how bout you send a mid rounder to chicago for jeffries...and send ertz to the niners for smith. solves 3 problems#eaglestalk
no i still like ertz
i'm over him. so many tes out there that strike fear into opposing defenses...he's in year 4 and nowhere close to doing that
to me ertz doesn't get targeted enough to make an impact.. now he's in chipping and blocking and you see less



can't wait for the party &amp; jeremih show
i tried buyin tix for me n the homie but they sold out im mad now the prices are inflated as a mug :(
the prices they're going for now are how much the meet &amp; greets were

insurance increased yearly prior 2 #obamacare existing. quit lying2voters
insurance rates go up because people don't know what the er is for

so stressed 



you can get away with whatever you want in life. you just have to be beautiful.
consensus is women disappear to society around forty and i only got 14 years to go
yeah it's terrifying. i feel like if i don't have a family i'll probably kill myself before 50.
i can't wait to rock my 40s though, single or not. i want to be that 40 year old with too much confidence and too high of heels



i can never find someone to study w me
hmm
you "only study by yourself"
i just don't like people talking to me and distracting me when i'm trying to study 



chilis 3 for me...$10

haha i just remembered that i served a plate of pasta that had a screw driver in it ????? that was frikin random
"um excuse me miss, there happens to be a screwdriver in my noodles and i'm not too happy about it"

u murdered someone with pasta. i'm calling the authorities.



november is gonna be lit! traveling every weekend... arky game, medical school interviews in al and iowa, lsu game, fsu game. i'm excited! 
i lived in iowa for awhile when i was younger.... iowa city is decent, cold as shit in the winter... super freakin cold.

when you lose a war, you usually first blame the generals, not the foot soldiers.whose fault is trump? start with folks like priebus.
whos that
the slack-jawed yokel in charge of the rnc.
ohhh. yeah, if trump had got the nomination without any help from the rnc then i'd still be calling myself a republican now.



local government in 1 word only - so far i only have 'struggling' and 'heterogeneous'... any more? it's important #odisummit research :)
"constrained"

do the barrage of cardstock vote blah on blah! mailers actually inform anyones vote? is there actually any math on that anywhere?
just prior to the big day. its hard to know how much is mailers vs tv vs friends vs overheard conversations at starbucks.

in your departments, do graduate students perform any of the admin duties for invited speakers? schedule  travel, itinerary, meals, etc?
nope. we organize and invite for one student lecture but admin does all logistics.
right. this is how it should go i think. everyone is misunderstanding my question. obviously students also meet/greet w speakers.
i get you bro.



first "proper" game of star wars lcg last night, 2 core sets, 10 pods. wow. totally different game. i can see how ppl get hooked...
meanwhile i'm grinding out games getting my decks ready for worlds next week! it's a great game
good luck with that. can't see myself ever playing competitively, but fun to dig bit deeper under the surface
it's really a blast, though this will be my first experience at worlds. the community is really great



good morning i'm thinking deeply about the film the wrestler. may be time for a rewatch.
its cranking its way up to being the best arnofsky film, which is odd
the only things he's done since then are black swan and noah, which i've never seen because i typically don't do bible films
but i'd be lying if i didn't say i was at least passingly curious at aronofsky doing a bible movie.



i'm stressing at the moment.... my student center isn't working... 
mine not my roommates is working. the struggle is real right now
this is annoying.. i guess this happens all the time.. obviously they need to change something
for real

that's good to hear! what's your thoughts on the possibility that dem hillary clinton will be the first "woman" us president?
looks like it's hers to lose and how blue she can make congress
the dem's need to pick up four or five seats to be the majority party in the us senate on nov 8th? i'm very optimistic!
same here, i'm in jersey this week and watching the swing state ads, it's fierce.

my opinion on the hand with benger is that he angled you by making false accusations of breaking the rules to tilt you
definitely the dumbest thing i've read on twitter. maybe ever
you're calling me dumb and yet don't realize that griffin benger can't see kassouf's hole cards. you know, that's how poker works
if you read the second part of my comment i say how his attack on kassouf was designed for kassouf to make a play w/ marginal hand



someone call me

not confident about tonight. think chelsea might steamroll us.
we have an outside chance but it's tough. a lot depends on how seriously conte is taking the competition.least we're improving
they have no europe so i'd imagine it'll be a strong team from them. hopefully it's a good game!
it will get intense if we go beyond 90 mins. like leeds norwich. just so long as we don't see repeats of their weekend lol



why doesn't everyone live in minneapolis? i love this city so much.
i miss it so much. 
come back sometime. it's the best.

is it shady to go on dates just for the free food asking for a friend
nope. you're trading your time for food.

being in nursing school is so bad. if i get a stomachache, i immediately start thinking about ch. 25 "gastrointestinal disorders"
ill be reading up on esophageal diverticulum and in the end i just really need to fart. i hate nursing school.
that's me with my muscle aches which are constant i always think i fucking have fibromyalgia  which i may have but it scares
me because i over think it but ever since i stared i diagnose myself with like cancer when it's just a little ache 



me: wow leslie jones said some transphobic shitsome random: yeah!! she's also a racist against white people!me: ... lol no
i blame trump for a lot of this tbh.
the few who've come into my mentions saying random, ignorant shit have been trump supporters lmao
i rest my case.



imagine being on a cruise ship full of celtic punk band because apparently that's a real thing

yellow stitches man



you know what? f**k clients who don't pay on time. or at all. you do your best for them, and for nothing. have more to say, but will not.
ever been stiffed by someone worth $750,000,000? this guy has!!! lolthat shit is the worst and why i quit working in film.
ugh.
there needs to be an off the record podcast where pro creatives tell horror stories anonymously with their voices modulated!



i'm such a crafty/creative person, that when i don't do anything creative i feel sad. and i want to do so many things but can't decide

be careful
with what ? 
with life



something about blonde hair and blue eyes that just catches your attention.

the homeland
don't forget about the hidden hitler switch that stays lowkey until they get mad at you



these wikileaks emails are all like, pretty reasonable people working together to solve kinda complicated political problems boring
tbh the only real thing that's sticking with me are the "journalists" that were working in tandem with the campaign during primaries
i mean it doesn't look great for journalists, but buttering up a source has a place in the craft
as a retired journalist we/i routinely did much worse shit than pretending we cared about the schmucks we covered



i can already tell this weekend is gonna be one for the books and it only monday
what's going on this weekend?
there's like four or five different parties! i don't even know which one to go too

i spent the last hour trying to convince my friend to name her new cat h r puffinstuff to no avail
you know hes in a new show called mutt n stuff? my 2yo is obsessed.
really? i might need to check that out
same guys that made the old show made this one. nod to that show. hes a special guest periodically.



soooo lssu has a former major junior player on their team that's leading their team in scoring... thats not legal#thingsthatmakeyouwonder
but if theres shenanigans there, ill take forfeits on the debacles this weekend.
he also went back to tier 3 juniors for some time too. coaches recruited him knowing he was semi-pro. violation?
i suggest that you refer this to your coaching staff.  tell lance that geof morris sent you.



you know what i'm very very suspicious of? women who exercise without tying their hair back
would you approve of my sweatband look?
yes, i think it's fine. i'm mostly talking about women with straight hair down to their butts!!!
i know what you mean...this is why i will not be returning to the cobble hill pure barre



looking forward the your call with tommy, man. i was in atl up until a few years ago; awesome town.
i've listened for the last couple of hours; thanks for the cool-headed discussion. hope to see you on future broadcasts.
thanks bro. i appreciate the text and acknowledgment.
my pleasure; i hope he takes your advice to heart. i really enjoy his insight, but you were making solid arguments.



recurring theme of speakers at #seu16. not crowdfunding, no iot. bootstrapped design, engineering and fabrication out of garages. proper
then local motors. oh well.
time for their software subs to be paid again?
... don't they use catia for vehicle design?



please tell me you two are connecting at #citylabmia!
missed each other this time. hopefully there will be another opportunity soon!
yes, you two will have much to discuss... when things normalize a bit, maybe we could schedule a short call!
sounds great!

what the hell did you have for breakfast. cee lo or craps
bowl of trip 4s
jesus. go get a 20 dollar scratcher on break. let it ride



. i'm all for anything that could get rid of the arrogant umpires
skunk drunk billy martin was a saint back in the day, cocaine 70's-80's,roids in the 90's, now bad upmires?
i just think they make it too much about themselves. a player even looks at them the wrong way they're ejected.
plus, one thing huge totally overlooked item by everyone, 1% of ump's speak spanish, is that a problem?
i'm sure it is a problem, but unless mlb requires them to learn there's not much to be done other than translators



and i understand fsu has worked w/the seminole nation and technically gotten "permission" but that doesn't mean all indigenous ppl approve
like at cmu the college and the local chippewa group work together to do research and to preserve the native culture
that doesn't mean sports teams mocking native americans isn't racist. are you just being dense or what?
hey i'm just trying to understand sorry. by no means am i defending the cleveland indians, fuck that noise, but i brought up
cmu because their mascot is the chippewa and the question has come to change the mascot and the tribe fought to keep it as such



ain't no one ever tryna smoke  i got 9 gs to blowwwww

per local news again this morning, we apparently have to worry about all teens in the city. "teens" attacked a bus now. #smh
i honestly don't understand the fixation on race.
who mentioned race?
i was not careful enough to avoid it. my bad ; ).
the news seems to be the folks with the fixation - too afraid to mention it when it is relevant to the story and public safety.



i really miss you more, wanna hang out
i literally cannot leave my house until thursday because school is life
next week, we're hanging
you know i don't like to do anything.....
sucks bc we're going on an adventure

comedians aren't politicians. they exist to hold a mirror up to society. #lookatyourselves
we are monsters and cringe, then run away screaming.
plato's cave theory strikes again.
i know not plato's theories. i prefer to discover humans one at a time.
humans are overrated.

before, drake was cotton soft, now he's a bully bc he responded to bars that mention his name.
he's still cotton soft. he just got flow. idk how we let a toronto kid act so thug and get away with it 
 he's just giving out bars to the people who asked for them
he can do that without pretending he got heat and shit lol. sit down jimmy! 
i do the same thing, let chubbs have his hands dirty lol you see dreamchasers didn't do anything

i wish everytime i opened the door to get out of my car, 11 beautiful white doves would come flying out in slow motion
and six days from tokyo drift plays in the back.
thats one of the best soundtracks ive ever heard, that would be perfect.
damn right... tokyo drift has the best opening in film history
lol fr, ive watched it at least half a dozen times for no reason.



my job hired this 30 year old lady and i thought she was aight but she swears she's got a gaydar
this girl customer walked in n my coworker goes "yup that girl likes girls"
i was like "how u kno" n she was like "i jus kno what ppl like" then i asked "what do i like" n she said "no comment don't wanna b rude"
she sounds gross lmao wtf, why do people think that's an appropriate work conversational topic?
its weird but to be fair i'm the supervisor n break every written rule there openly at the same time so i can't drag them

stranger things on netflix had the lamest ending ever 
ayy you finally watched it omg
dude there was so much hype about it and the ending killed it, i expected way more
well there filming season2 already so it might answer the confusing questions at the end
hopefully!!



what happened to screen doors? i miss screen doors. a nice way to kind of have your door open for neighbors.
they are still big here!  a lot of old houses have nice wooden ones, which make a nice sound when they close!
i love those old wooden ones! here in ontario they're getting rare.
there's a place up the coast, near where we like to get away for the weekend, that makes them. quite expensive, but super nice!
you're in maine? it's very similar to my home province nova scotia. really love maine.



you can get away with whatever you want in life. you just have to be beautiful.
consensus is women disappear to society around forty and i only got 14 years to go
yeah it's terrifying. i feel like if i don't have a family i'll probably kill myself before 50.
i can't wait to rock my 40s though, single or not. i want to be that 40 year old with too much confidence and too high of heels
wait no, in my 50s that's when you can start being really gross and you can just blame it on being old. i like that.

i'm sending back the pixel. i prefer the gs7 over it. i prefer plain android but gs7 looks and feels better
i really love my gs7! except for the glass back, as we've already discussed. :/ what was bad about pixel?
the screen doesn't look that good. at some point the edges look a bit blurry like the optics of glass are off.
bummer! sounds like the usual quality issues that nexus was known for.

sweet. we knew it! so know that you're back on the grind, are you going to the gym every day??
not every day but as much as possible. looking into 530am sessions.



would much rather have two more stud d in this lineup #trouba #lindholm with the young fs than #kadri and #jvr those d will mature at 26.
jets want a stud d in return. reilly only one that fits their wants.
really? they should rethink that. #little is miscast with too many minutes. kads would alleviate the minutes.
problem is kadri is overpaid. no way anyone takes that contract.
what? he has a great contract! he is a 2- c unlike #little who is a 3+ with much more grit and more offence.

so, we will probably see miguel montero vs. trevor bauer tonight. that might be somewhat entertaining. like bauer needs the added motivation
really? i'm surprised it's not willson contreras starting at catcher for them
montero usually catches arrieta. we'll see. they may opt for contreras given time of year, but montero normally does.
contreras scares me hahaha

big difference between discerning a ball/strike in baseball and fumble/catch in football.
theres more to look at in football. in baseball, a computer as you see on tv, can do it instantly.
ball/strike is a black and white call. two states. fumbles and catches are not.
black and white calls should be decided by technology. especially when a baseball is moving 80-105 mph.



theoretically, lets say you have a companion, should it be controlled by the leader or act depending on the situation in the fight?
is this for bs? how's the combat work right now? i think that would be an important influence on the direction you take.
personally i don't find ai companions very fun or game-changing, they're often just... there.
it'd be cool to implement a coop mode w this feature though. not sure how accessible that'd be on the roblox platform tho.
if it's turned-based definitely assume control. making it ai just creates a variable out of your control.



holy fuck i hate cpanel.
that's a bummer. we're not for everyone, though, i understand. is there anything i can do to help?
nope. my provider includes it by default, and it is not the easiest to clean out. all good now. i think. less you, more them.
totally understandable. if i can help you minimize the impact at all, or answer any other questions, definitely let me know!
thanks, and thanks for reaching out!

watching this tnt nba deal about race, such weak sauce, so out of touch of the legit issues of the movement, why bother then
like...what...is...the...point if you're giving one sided opinions?
can at least one of them talk about their experience about how they were fd with because of their race, they have stories
especially jim brown. they're not offering anything outside of typical victim/community blaming. this is solving nothing.
barkley is so out of touch, he is an uncle tom

replaying all the bioshock games i have come to realize infinite wasnt that great. :/
we didn't talk about this? i fell for the hype, but infinite is ridiculously overrated.
the burial at sea episodes are a lot better. not just because it was rapture, the gameplay was just heavily improved.
gear system is a fucking joke. how do you go from bs1/2 system to a 5 item gear system. the actual fuck.
ywah man, infinite is bullshit. i don't know what the devs were thinking, it's so watered down compared to 1

america has all sorts of problems, but the american view of religious freedom is far superior to the lacit of europe.
how so?
for one, in america, symbols of religion, like the hijab, are accepted, which helps people of different faiths assimilate.
okay. what else?
america also allows people to freely profess religion in public spaces. this can go too far, but so can enforced secularism.

eh, i guess i'd rather they were just as annoyed with daredevil as i am.
haven't seen the new season. what's gone bad?
i liked the first season. 2nd season doesn't live up to the nuance of the other marvel shows.
how do you feel about luke cage so far? the marvel show for me know where i didn't get the hype was jessica jones.

listen though. today may have started out awful but now you're seasoned &amp; prepared so make the rest of it wonderful

here's hoping that and coffee helps



if you're only supposed to be a nut and i've made that clear don't causally text me on "wyd?" dry ass convo type shit.

re: that trump cocktail menu... the trumps (&amp; those that aspire to be) seem to do a lot of "trying to act like they think rich people would"
like, hmmm... a drink with oysters and caviar in it? that sounds fancy... clearly a rich person would drink this!
oh, i can put gold lame curtains up over a gilded window frame? this is surely what a wealthy person would do because they're wealthy.
it's all pretend and artifice... like a kid trying on his father's sportcoat and shoes.
more like putting lipstick on a pig.

so tell them to stop carrying one crappy made in china knock off line (ivanka) so we can all happily shop there
also, why punish all the other labels and businesses? if you don't like a product, don't buy it.
if they feel the impact they will drop her one crappy knockoff line and we can all be happy
seriously, just don't buy it. are you a #fashion designer or something?



good morning i'm thinking deeply about the film the wrestler. may be time for a rewatch.
its cranking its way up to being the best arnofsky film, which is odd
the only things he's done since then are black swan and noah, which i've never seen because i typically don't do bible films
youre not missing much with noah, honestly. black swan was fine.
i saw black swan. it retreaded a lot of the themes of wrestler, but felt like aronofsky wanted to be more "aronofsky" with it



kinda just wanna chill w my yfl brothas n sistas bc y'all fam af love u all. if ur from yfl or kfl or sfl or cbfl....i luv u!!! s/o to u

ross cheated on rachel idc fight me!!
actually they were on a break
omg! don't do this!! so it makes it okay for him to cheat? if rachel would have done it every man would think otherwise 
buttt if she had never said she needed "a break from us" he never would have done any of that stuff!
point is he cheated and he knows he fucked up big time that's why the ended up breaking up 



man, yuri on ice's ending song is so inspiring as well. even if i knew nothing about the anime, the opening and ending songs are so
symbolic and self-inspiring. it's a good message to anyone trying to go after their dreams.
not to mention, yuri isn't a prodigy. he's some normal awkward young twenty something that's coming into his own. i love that.
like i can see so much of myself in him. lacking the confidence, being anxious, believing in somebody so much. it's perfect.
i agree.

spurs and cavs both looked pretty good last night.



don't think i'll ever get over 700 followers permanently. always lose one as soon as i do.
to be fair, 700 people is about 699 more than should actually be following me.
look on the bright side. when i was your age i had, like, 0 followers.
i don't think you had readily available internet either?
nope. no email either. cell phones were still a bit of a rarity.



to be here asap
uno more montho! 
hurryyyyy
i'm trying  don't pressure me
i know you are.



#hereiamwithher wondering how screwed up you have to be to vote for her just because she has a vagina.
it's more like because hillary has a brain in her head, unlike her opponent who needs to be, off to see the wizard..
according to wikileaks she's not to bright and that's coming from the ppl who work for her.
have you actually even gone to wikileaks or do you just read the edited and highlighted stuff they pass around twitter?
i've read them yes and that's lame to try to say it's edited. yesterday i read one where they needed to sober her up, lol

so is wikileaks credible? can anyone say for sure? it seems like no one knows and what u believe is based on ur party
i don't think there is any evidence that they have doctored materials.
so wikileaks is sort of like snowden? if what they are saying is credible, honest liberal media should cover that too... yeah?
ny times with a huge cover story on new wikileaks today. not sure why you think the liberal media isn't covering?
ok today exactly they did, before this or no?



with all the chaos surrounding trump's loutishness and racism, the gop's actual policy platform seems to have been set aside this election.
but lest we forget, the gop's policy platform is still absolutely terrible. exhibit a: the #russellamendment.
several months ago, the house gop added this amendment, a "religious liberty" clause, into their version of the national defense bill.
the amendment's author, rep. steve russell, and its supporters, bill it as preventing military chaplains from violating their conscience.
i guess that war doesn't violate their consciences; not the religious figures i know.



my baby cousin is 15 and be netflix and chilling and babygirl over here can't even get a text back!

it's so much i wish i could do to help change the usa, but i don't want a job in politics.
accept the call
i can't do politics...  i just can't.
lol i would lay an excerpt on you but its too late for all that
tell me in the am then. it's always good to hear people's opinion.



fourth, qpf amount. think 1-2" covers it. could see a few higher amounts midcoast w/secondary low. slightly lower amts possible n mountains.
that should put a nail in the drought for many locations. precip still below normal but not drought level i'd think.
sadly not. we'd need the next 2-3 months to replenish all the water. 3yr deficits 12"+. a step in the right direction though!
3 year deficit? not in my part of maine. i'm not aware of any part of maine in a 3 year drought. it's well less than a year here
in the last three years here in the foothills where i'm at, qpf has averaged much above average. very wet till last winter.



would tweet more, at least half of what i natter on about regarding politics or pop culture comes because she challenges me
what have i done now?
nothing. you are generally wonderful and i wish you tweeted more. the world needs more kiki !
just haven't felt i had anything worthwhile to contribute lately. sorry.
piffle, i spend half my time tweeting things you made me think about.



dad: do you think i'm an asshole? me: wtf??? where did that question even come from? no. lol #mydadisweird #justdadthings  #sorandom
he probably asked u cuase someone must have told him he was acting like 1. so now he's like hmm . thats what i do sometimes
i think it's cuz i'm always yelling at him it's cuz he always thinks i'm lying to him. he hates when i go out. and i go out a lot
well thats what happens when ur a single gal. wat does he expect for u to stay trapped in the house
haha i guess. like i went to a concert last night, and he didn't believe me cuz it was on a monday hahaha  i had to show proof



agents of shield is possibly one of the worst marvel tv shows i've ever seen honestly the plot is boring and messy
not to mention overly heteronormative !!!
i never started watching it. now i'm glad.
its a waste of time! there are far better shows out there to watch
tbh, before it even started airing, the trailers i saw for it just never caught my interest.

fun fact: apparently alka seltzer night can trigger the symptoms of a panic attack, which are similar to the symptoms of a heart attack
-so you might end up calling 911 and having 7 police, firemen, and emts in your living room at 2:30am!
wooooooooow

perpetually more of frontend community happenings seems deliberately engineered to intimidate the outsider, and push out the non-obsessive
the real face of progress in frontend dev would be that everyones job would get easier, less cognitive load
the exact opposite is happening. all your frameworks are abject disasters. your cute names for permutations of shims or whatever are insane
not really sure how to end this, but knock that shit off. this would be a great year for everyone to come to their damn senses
chris i think your time machine dropped you off in the wrong year



6 am. trucks not gonna work on itself
if your going to dumont i want a ride in it

if u come across someone u know well enough on tinder is it alright to platonically swipe right
yes
ok good bc i overthink tinder 2 much
back when i used to have it, i'd find people i knew and send them gifs of dogs

this is the type of person david is:
me, as i walk around the apartment: "i think my back is broken!"david: "adi, no, you can't be serious...if your back was actually broken
u wouldnt be able to walk. u would be screaming. you do know that, right? i just need you to understand that ur back isn't actually broken."
i honestly don't think he understands that people sometimes say stuff that's not meant to be taken literally...he just doesn't get it
shallow thinking or autism



parents who smoke marijuana, what age(s) do your kids have to be for you to 1, accept their marijuana use, and 2, smoke it with them?
not a parent, but i'm happy i didn't till college
i was seeing phish before i smoked, think that had more impact than peer pressure ever did in middle school.
same only allman bros and ratdog
i saw rat dog once.



the suggestions people give for deadpool 2... and even from filmmakers... i'm starting to think everyone is doing a bit.
neveldine/taylor? too on the nose?
that actually would make sense, if they still were a team.
shit, i didnt know they split. bummer.
that one still makes more sense than anything i've heard.



we were literally seconds from leaving the house when it was revealed that jake was wearing two pairs of undies, which caused a delay.
he couldn't just wear both pair?
it wasn't comfortable- " i just feel too puffy."
well you wouldn't want to be too puffy at school.
the last thing i need is call from school that he peed his pants because he couldn't get his jeans off

if we want to support kids we'll go watch junior hockeysame old story... suck it up buttercups and ice a team
if you think that we're somehow just supposed to be a contender because we drafted matthews you're surely mistaken man
i don't think... i absolutely know, without a goalie, the team is nothing. anyone who thinks otherwise isn't up to speed
obviously having a goalie is the biggest need for a team to be successful not sure how u possibly got that i don't get that

but if you asked me to choose gsw over the field for the title i'm not sure i'd do that anymore. definite defensive issues.
after one of playing together? lol
i didn't say they stink...said i'd take the field over them. not unreasonable
no. but to say they have definite defensive issues after 4 quarters might be pushing it.
i think its more roster makeup. only reliable true big might be zaza.

man i always forget what a fun take tucker and dale vs evil is on the hillbilly slasher film.
it is quite a gem
i think that and "behind the mask: the rise of leslie vernon" are the best alternate takes on horror flicks

definitely check it out it's fun.

once you visit home for a few days you realize how much college *isn't* home. it's really hard not to feel isolated
don't worry, it will become your second home-which is almost equally as homey as home 
idk. it's more the people. my family is so close to me, they care about me so much, its a huge absence when i'm in sm

talk to me about your fav films.
: blade runner (1982) made me fall in love with filmmaking, and got me interested in genres, special effects and set design.
adding it to my watchlist. i'm sure i watched it as a tot but i don't remember.

hard to believe usa today has article with the title about cleveland is the new city of champions. guess expectations are lower these days
the teams are great this year, the city...not so much.
just not sure 1 championship justifies a new title for a city
just another hot take from the instant gratification generation.   what's your take on millers use in playoffs?  over use?
nope. he is doing what needs to be done to win games. that's what a professional gets paid for and what he loves to do



i'm about to say something here about #parenting and #life and you might have to stick with me for a minute.
i've been having some mental health issues since nola was born and you could say i'm not living my best life.
but nola is a "perfect" child. not really i know, but she's smart and cute and everyone immediately falls in love with her.
and i want her to look cute in her clothes because i don't.
yup. i def get this. luckily oliver still lets me choose his clothes but i hear girls are different

heres the thing i think i understand about why america isnt going to brexit: uk is 92% white. us is 64%, and shrinking every four years.
brexit didnt have a gendered component that would reasonably skew a vote difference. all of american politics does. every last race.
the reality is, liberals have won 5 of last 6 popular vote elections because we are not archie bunkers country anymore. and haven't been.
to someone like trump, is a reaction to something that's already happened.
100%. white males can scream loudly on their way down but they're still falling into the abyss. meanwhile i'm ::dark phoenix gif::



i just desperately wrote "iced vanilla chai" in tiny handwriting on a post-it note at work.
where's ur fav chai from for me it's the nordstrom cafe
i'm a dumb lil chai noob and all i've had is store brands and starbucks! i need to go to nordstrom stat 
i like starbucks too but nc is like french kissing a cinnamon stick!!!
attn: tweet-up at the nordstrom cafe/everyone must order chai/everyone must french kiss a cinnamon stick



sorry to ask something so grim but how would you translate    ?
i went for "cure". hmu if you have better.
"to kill with kindness"? (i.e., offering a shower with the disguised goal of beating your foe, etc.)
do you realise quote is about gas chambers?
yes. "cure with gas chamber"--what do you think the irony refers to (assuming in this context not an actual gas chamber)?



i really want to shave my head again and get a tattoo right on my head!

someone wants to trade irvin to atl for a 7th rd pick? what?! you sound like someone who goes 1-16 on madden franchise mode...
don't rip on him to hard raider brother.
i just don't understand the logic... or should i say the lack of logic
fandom can be myopic &amp; not logical at times raider brother. we all want to win so bad that we don't always think straight.
you got that right



pharrell's collab w/ adidas on these nmds are decent, but $340 fam? skrt skrt !

i wonder if swift is important part of apple's car work. the stability concerns make a lot of sense for mission critical systems like cars.
ergg, skeptical of this one. many mission-critical systems are written in c or similar.
swift itself ain't that stable.
i don't think the programming language is the utmost concern with problems like these.
and  i'd be surprised if apple was using swift for anything like that at this point given how the syntax continues to change.

i love being a spurs fan
warriors need some rim protection or it's gonna be a short postseason bro.. i know you're loving simmons. where he come from??
juco and the d league! ya i've been saying they defense and bench are trouble. nobody listened...spurs looked fresh and excited
i think they're bench is fine they just have zero rim protection. like it's sad
true that but i'm ok with it as long as the spurs are playing like that 



hacks helming them aside, why are studios greenlighting adaptations of video-game franchises that are far past their peak popularity?
i think games like uncharted or red dead redemption are great starting points for fun exercises in specific genres.
get the right director/writer to conjure up a fun story to tell within that genre, slap the title on and bam.
i'd be this optimistic if studios didn't think the right director/writer would be shawn fucking levy
it's even more annoying knowing that joe carnahan wrote the script. potentially great script wasted on mediocre filmmaker.



ok boy. if you're going to sit with me at dinner, don't roast me the whole time plz. i'd rather eat alone. thx.
also. i accidentally flushed my sock down the toilet. what a day, guys. what. a. day.

i'm about to say something here about #parenting and #life and you might have to stick with me for a minute.
i've been having some mental health issues since nola was born and you could say i'm not living my best life.
but nola is a "perfect" child. not really i know, but she's smart and cute and everyone immediately falls in love with her.
and i want her to look cute in her clothes because i don't.
people are gonna think she's cute no matter what. and learning to make those decisions is a developmental milestone!



hahahah i'm making money while u in school or at home eating shit u dumbasses

once you visit home for a few days you realize how much college *isn't* home. it's really hard not to feel isolated
don't worry, it will become your second home-which is almost equally as homey as home 
idk. it's more the people. my family is so close to me, they care about me so much, its a huge absence when i'm in sm

i mean it's not all bad it's a huge blessing i have that all. i guess i didn't realize how important distance to them was for me

rudy giuliani has really showed his true colors, dumb as a bag of rocks!!!
and your verdict is based on what evidence #truthmatrs
just by listening to his remarks and how he refuse to allow rational thoughts and statements to come out if his mouth
listening to his remarksyou can't argue that ccuomo would not let rjuliano answer a question w/o interruption #truthmatrs
chris wld correct him with facts, and to u and ur idiot candidate, i walked to store, got two loaves of bread, ddnt get shot



im tryna be patient for another fucking hour but it's hhaaaarrrddd
can you believe ill be 17 wow
yes because seventeen comes after sixteen and you were born almost seventeen years ago
lmao i still feel like a child
your age do not determine your childlike nature, u can always be a child @ 



some folks on the right seem to be upset because i'm not name-calling and bashing megyn kelly. i like her. deal with it. 
you can like her just don't call her a real unbiased journalist
i don't think megyn kelly is biased. everyone on the right seems to think she is, but i don't see it. 
take off your rose colored glassed and actually look...she's not only biases but very nasty
nah. not really.



i voted for perot, he was right about nafta &amp; so was i. why are some people  voting for trump? he isn't hillary, &amp; vice versa
i know many people who think both parties are just in it for themselves, thus they both suck of the teats of wall street.
to make matters even worse, you have pundits like joe &amp; the like create wedges, and offer opinions that have no substance.
made in the usa used 2 mean something, now all the manufacturing jobs are elsewhere. why? so corporate america can get more $
it's a global econ. forigen firms build plants in us. us builds plants overseas. been going on for decades



the amount of times i have pressed snooze today is embarrassing
it's okay you deserve it
you're so cute 
love u
love you more 



"if you're making people awesome &amp; delivering value continuously, somehow people stop caring about estimates." - #modernagile
you're missing another qualifier: your competition sucks. we do the first two and need estimates constantly.
what for jay?
there's roi on all that we build. customers prioritize based on highest roi, which is impacted by build cost
yes, shipping highest roi fastest is the goal. build options &amp; their cost must be considered to hit that goal.



macos sierra lets you remap the esc key to another modifier key. whew. say gbye, caps lock :) #newmacbookpro
what?! no! how will you convey anger or excitement?!
use the shift key like a civilized person. only barbarians with poor manual dexterity use caps lock!
eh?
ie: hold down the shift key for words you want capitalized, instead of willy-nilly caps locking everything like a barbarian :)



the only reason they don't? they will not deviate from #theplan which includes trusting #hunter and his drafting. allow picks to develop.
if that isn't their plan, which i guarantee it is, then they are morons.  never have more cap room than the next 2 yrs..
wrong. mentality is to win every game right now. management controls the time frame. that mentality though is fragile.
when you have 3 all stars on ecls you have no better time to load up
i agree. insulate. but the retained salary sucks and why blow the cap on risky ufas that restrict paying the young studs



so why hasnt the us of a added pins the the credit chip cards
some do have the option, but it's rare. seen a couple of customers at work that have to pin with their chip cards.
its just, ever since i can rme we here, the credit card by default had the pin number same as the debit  which can be changed.
usa is weird. none of us understand it either.
oh well,  cant always be on top!



bruh, it's dumb cold today 
it's new york, it's always cold
not always though. it didn't start getting cold until this week. last week, i was out here wearing a dress, vibin in the 80s.
it felt like 80 cause you lightskin smh
smh  not even. i heard lightskin folks stay cold. and while we're on it, you only like a shade darker than me though 



reminding folks that megyn kelly is not any kind of feminist icon to woc. not with all that racism.
as i see white women throwing kelly's name out as someone to admire i wonder just how close to white supremacy some of you want to be.
kelly has had no problem excusing police brutality, pushing her own racist narratives onto kids, and generally being a terrible person.
kelly's conflict with trump will end. and she will be right there on fox supporting ryan's racist classist policies. that's her job.
kelly's conflict with trump is in the script.



you busy bih?
nah doods i'm at mi casa con valeria chillin

thinking i might block off every friday for a month to mockup and dabble with new ideas.
in q1 of 2016 i did a new product build once a month in 24 hours. that was fun. team can't handle more product right now.
but would be fun to sketch, draw and scope all the random ideas i have. surely that would produce some tangental benefits somewhere else.
feel free to share them my way. you would like what i'm working on right now :)
tell me!! :)



nothing like my iphone going from 66% to 13% in 15 min..only took 1 pic &amp; texted hubby that i was at work. so tired of battery draining

that is weird. and frustrating
very much so! and i charged it once i got to work. shot from 13% to 64% in mere seconds!

hillary would be our 3rd black president if by "black president" u mean another president with a lot of black support doing nothing for them
over 90% of us aren't stupid for voting for hrc. we have a reason for voting the way we do. do u know why ur voting 4 trump
didn't say they were but this is the 3rdtime a large amount of black people voted4a president that couldn't care less about them
i agree....it's just that less than 5% who votes against their interest. 95% of us know what we're doing. #winning
continuing to supporting democrats and not getting anything out of it says otherwise



i seriously feel like one of my bffs hates me now 
wanna know who i hate?? benji. he peed on me.
sucks to be u 
i took him out of the kennel and he got all happy i carried him and he peed i threw his ass right back in
i forgot to warn you about that lmao. he just gets very excited!



please keep my dad in your prayers. 3rd time called down to the hospital this month, hoping this is the time the transplant finally happens.
surgery is on! please continue the prayers, now comes the long part! god is good.
i'm at the hospital. dad's surgery started around 2-3 am. please keep those prayers up for a tough 8-10 hour transplant. god is good.
praying so hard man! im happy for your family that he's finally getting the surgery he needs.
thank you so so much! we're praying hard down here!

#worldseries

1-0 baby. that's what i'm talking about. i hope they dont have to wait another 108 years, but i hope they do have to wait 1 more
i don't know! cleveland can't match the pitching depth that the cubs have and i'm hoping that's what tips the scales our way!



got my back on this one #inkmaster 
good thing he doesn't listen to dark matter yet ... "snacks up your ass ..."  (hope everything's ok though) 
yes he managed to blow the marble out of his nose. seriously almost shit my pants. 
good story &amp; btw todd &amp; dan need callers tonight ... 
shit forgot about the whole time difference crap 



good morning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good morning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
ill see you tmrw!!!!!!
wait what raves are you doing this weekend
not the same raves as y'all but lauren said we were pregamning together and ur coming to the edm brunch



theoretically, lets say you have a companion, should it be controlled by the leader or act depending on the situation in the fight?
is this for bs? how's the combat work right now? i think that would be an important influence on the direction you take.
personally i don't find ai companions very fun or game-changing, they're often just... there.
it'd be cool to implement a coop mode w this feature though. not sure how accessible that'd be on the roblox platform tho.
if it's turned-based definitely assume control. making it ai just creates another variable you can't control.



well i got a $40 tip and then a $.30 tip just shows the high and low point of my day
man i got a .10 tip on sunday smh
rather just get 0! it's more embarrassing to give a few cents
exactly it's crazy! work this morning?
helping out mowing yeah with the our buddy!



you can't have a spirit of discernment without letting the holy spirit teach you on how to hear and how to see, both naturally&amp;spiritually
 you alonna, always with the positive messages
awww my girl!!!! thank you. it's always so good to hear encouragement 
of course. stay positive and you 
yes ma'am! love you sis 



i wish i have something longer term to look forward to??? i feel like i've essentially been going from place to place and everything felt
like it was a temporary stage towards something else and i hate it. i just want to find a place to settle down and be surrounded
by friends and people i love and be able to really go all out on what i want to do.
then i wanna go home, but i dont wanna leave vancouver because i feel like this is where i should be, but at the same time...
i hope sometime in the near future we will all be reunited again. we are still young and there's a lot to explore



when we not talking shit, that's how you know that's not normal
lmao. tbh.
there isn't a day where we don't talk shit. it's like a must every time we see each other.
always got shit to tell each other. i'm surprised u ain't tell me shit while you were in government 
he wasn't even there in class lmao. i think they find out that he was skipping.



you can see so many stars here, it's beautiful. home is nice 
fuckin' stay there
i'm just kidding i love you

it's rough
started at 315.  20 minutes in and i'm already at a loss for words....
that...was disturbing.



i think i'm single idk tho
lol
i'm actually confused
how do you not know lol
bruh it's a long story but just know he ain't call back



i killed a mouse today!  
yay, you great hunter. ive killed lots of lizards and bugs but never a mouse.
i don't know what the mouse was thinking??  why come into a house with 2 ferocious felines??
and then that mouse had the nerve to try to eat our kibble!  let this be a lesson fur all the other mousies!  
well, that is just simply the limit! a lesson for sure! glad you made an example of him! rrrrrrrroar!



5:30am and the garbage truck slams the dumpster to the groundat the school across the street, won't miss that when we move
lol  garbage day here to an i live next to the school.  same. thing.
this happens every morning even in the summer when there is no school
yep and the windows are open an it scares the shit outta ya
and the twice a day traffic shit show with parents



before the army i was wild doing dumb shit in relationships now i'm just ready to settle down and enjoy life and adventure with somebody
respect bro! 
off rip bro 
proud of you too my g fr
i'm trying man i'm trying.. tryna stay above water &amp; focused until i'm where i need to be. proud of you to foo &amp; thats 



everyday i'm getting more and more sick of #facebook, considering how prolific it is, is it possible to truly disengage from that site?
i deleted my fb account over a year ago and havent looked back.
... maybe i just need to remove the app from my phone (no notifications) and just use the site once in a while &amp; keep the chat
yeah, i gradually weaned myself off of it over 6 months or so.
if i tried to drop twitter right now, though, id probably have a hard time with that



i usually listen to the local cleveland radio broadcast of indians games. feels like i won't want to listen to fox bcast.too much cubs slant
that would be joe buck.
i listened to tv crew some last night. buck was fine. went on and on abt lindor and kluber. he'll be unbearable in chicago.
the silver lining in cardinals not making playoffs was no buck.
buck lost me when he called that packers vikings game where randy moss fake mooned gb and he acted like moss killed someone



coworker asked me who will win more games? browns all season or tribe in the world series 
how did you answer?
let me just say tribe needs 4 wins that's all. browns might have a chance at 2 wins...maybe lol
i agree.
they want the #1 pick again for sure. and if they win any games it could lose them that pick (see hoyer)



, you suck. #comcastsucks
hello mari. i'd like to see what i can do to help you see the game.  please dm your acct# and i can see what i can do to help. -ql
too late. we went out and by the time we came back it was on. it was still a pita.
i apologize about that, are the services back to normal now? dp
well, yes, but that doesn't make up for having to scramble to find a place to watch the game.



didn't play any songs of #theblack :( i had expected they would play the ones that aren't about danny.
it was probably easier to go with songs danny knew the marks for already since they didn't have much time



will start playing songs from #theblack again because people love the songs. x
we love the old songs as well 



where are the chill ass nice dudes at?
was asking myself this today smh
i'm lucky if anyone talks to me at this point if i'm being honest with myself

i just want to travel the world and make amazing memories. that's all.
come to australia
do not tempt me
no seriously, i'll be here probably until may!
might have to come for spring break



people wish i drew pokemon a lot more, and yet no one commissions them. i don't understand.
90 percent of the art i do has to be commission work to pay bills and such. i will gladly draw other things for money.
this! so many times people want to see more fan art of poke, but unless its a commission, its hard to fit in free art time
maybe i should put more pokemon examples on my commission example sheet.
thats an idea! i think i need to update my examples too

watching this tnt nba deal about race, such weak sauce, so out of touch of the legit issues of the movement, why bother then
like...what...is...the...point if you're giving one sided opinions?
can at least one of them talk about their experience about how they were fd with because of their race, they have stories
especially jim brown. they're not offering anything outside of typical victim/community blaming. this is solving nothing.
i have so much respect for him too, he is too old for this conversation

so, they have the power, the control, and they've tried to silence #julian assange .    just my thoughts.

i just passed that government twat with a 90 &amp; did my review so i really gotta 100


you could've helped me
i didn't know 



what's the gender neutral equivalent of calling someone daddy or mommy in a kinky sense 
good question i wanna know so i can effectively kinkshame non binary ppl as well
bug mama 
"insectoid parental unit"
give it to me hard, insectoid parental unit !!!



wish i could memorize stuff after reading it once smh
that's because your mind doesn't care about what your reading lol.
it kinda does and it kinda doesn't because i actually find this stuff that i'm reading interesting lol
we'll see it's not 100%. yeah best way to memorize stuff is like review notes like an hour three or four times a day.
yeah i need to start going over my notes at least twice a day i just hate studying lol



white girls singing about "niggers" stealing shouldn't have had to face any repercussions? .....
nope bc evidently it was 1) a famous vine they repeated 2) there was no malicious intent 3) it was all freaking jokes
they're not 5 year olds. them repeating what they heard isn't an excuse. it does not matter if there was malicious intent.
of every race say that word all the time to their friends. there should've been no repercussions, if there had to be then
everybody  deserves those same reprimands. that's al i'm trying to get at



i don't have a lot of respect for those who hide behind neutrality on super-important topics. one of them will win. pick a fucking side.
you don't have to actually vote for either, but when asked a direct question you should be able to answer which you'd rather have.
frankly, i'd like to know where you stand at crunch time, and i think that's fair. "i don't like either" doesn't address the question.
they're not identical, so you should be able to choose between horse shit, or grandpa's follow-through even though neither are palatable.
there are &gt; two choices. weren't amoral



and i were snuggle/cuddle bunnies  blissfully wonderful 
sigh...my dreams about sam are always weird. one time he was my math teacher.
ew! that's sad
haha i would've been a math genius if he'd been my teacher in school! #hotteacher
no, you'd be a genius in something else all together #dirtygirl

"i believe that loss and emptiness and confusion often give way to new fullness and wisdom."
i just love this who said it

wait really? so how come you had to put quotes around it why didn't you just state your belief asking for a friend
hahahahah you caught me ;)



wtf should i watch
amber alert
is it good?
yea
if the description ass 



i heart the plastics because they aren't arrogant about america, even when we do things for them. misfits? they knooow we love them. #bbott
like the reason neeley going up was because kryssie didn't let us put scott up.
you don't even know if america would have put scott up. america doesn't really like the misfits if you haven't noticed. #bbott
i wasn't saying that i was repeating what kryssie said she's so delusional. i voted neeley all the way
omg- i am so sorry. i keep getting mean tweets from people about my plastics favoritism.



can we please stop with all the boomer-age senior managers here that just endlessly battle for power while providing zero value to the org??
if i see one more infographic or thinkpiece about millennials being lazy and boomers being producting i'll die
nearly every obstructionist i've encountered in office settings is 40+ and refuses to change at all argvhghhfserfvg
need an analyst yet because hi
hey dork did you read your fing text messages yet?



gya
i can't believe they have fingers and elbows in the end
they look like. lalafel. i think is the name??? ffxiv tinies. tiny dumpling lightning
yep lalafells. but lalafells are evil everyone who plays non-lalafells sacrifices lalafells for clears in raids.
holy fuck. seems fair though, they definitely look untrustworthy to me



stephanie, so excited for you! i love all the buzz caraval is getting! i can't wait to read it! congrats!!! &lt;3 &lt;3

would have happened ages ago if i had my way man haha.
great place. shame i was there when no sport was on!
you should come back when there is. great sporting city.



it's one game. warriors will be fine. but kd has shot a lot of okc type shots. not wide open, beautiful ball movement shots.
lol @ ppl talking shit about the dubs. they didn't lose to sacremento. they will be fine.
they thought they could walk in and beat anyone. they can't. they know that now &amp; will be perfectly fine.
they will struggle to protect the rim and rebound...but that's about it. their perimeter d is a+
yep. it actually took the spurs a bit to start getting penetration. started off by dumping it down into the post



my goal: to watch an episode of #thisisus without weeping uncontrollably. my hunch: it will not happen.
well i made it 51 minutes without crying. a new record. i was so close to getting to the end. damn you #thisisus !
does it count itself out if you were crying before,(a stubbed toe) stopped, then cried again? 26 minutes. #thisisus
was the second waterworks from the show or still the stubbed toe?
toe~then stopped~then started again during the show.



omfg. you phoned that one in. love your tweets, slow down and be you. your fine.
"you're."   
was kidding. your doing fine. i didn't mean to say it like that. you truly are a great writer
again... "you're." haha... no worries.
ok. but feel bad.



listen #leafsnation matthews,nylander,marner,our d etc... are all gonna take time to get better,this is a process,be patient #tmltalk
if we want to support kids we'll go watch junior hockeysame old story... suck it up buttercups and ice a team
if you think that we're somehow just supposed to be a contender because we drafted matthews you're surely mistaken man
i don't think... i absolutely know, without a goalie, the team is nothing. anyone who thinks otherwise isn't up to speed
we have a lot of inexperience on this team,so just as babcock/shanny said,it's gonna be bad before it gets good,but i'm all in



#wikileaks has confirmed everything non-hc shields have been saying about hillaryat least hillary being corrupted isn't up 4 debate anymore
if wikileaks is all u have...that's pathetic. every time they release emails, she widens her lead over trump and jill
no it isn't but they have proven hillary is a two faced person.
we have bernie and e.warren with us. i trust their judgment. whatever hrc is bernie is the same 4 supporting her.
b/c they don't like trump.warren and sanders were late to supporting her.sanders isn't like hillary



these fucks are really watching porn in my lounge
i do not believe
they stopped when they saw my tweet
was it tim
nah it wasn't... i won't tell who it was though

lord knows you deserve this happiness! love you s'much lexxxx
good gosh this is all i've been waiting for love you sm more tabbbs. 



if you could have one, would you want a hump day for your life? you'd wake up and know you were halfway to the end, no question about it.
100% of my anxiety comes from not having this.
like this morning, is this pain in my head an aneurysm that will pop any moment or just a headache. i will obsess all day
i get it sometimes when the heart does its "three beats on, one beat off" thing.
plus the practicality, if i knew today was the day my brain pops, i'm not going to work



. i'm all for anything that could get rid of the arrogant umpires
skunk drunk billy martin was a saint back in the day, cocaine 70's-80's,roids in the 90's, now bad upmires?
i just think they make it too much about themselves. a player even looks at them the wrong way they're ejected.
i agree to a point, strike zone is a mess, but do not know what they said to each other last night-all year? grudge?
i'm not sure what you mean.



whatd you get in 351
82/100 let's gooooooo woooooo !!!!!
lol how did you do on the test

i can't wait for the netflix marvel characters to finally join forces and beat the crap out of daredevil.
eh, i guess i'd rather they were just as annoyed with daredevil as i am.
haven't seen the new season. what's gone bad?
i liked the first season. 2nd season doesn't live up to the nuance of the other marvel shows.
i watched a few episodes and it just wasn't catching my attention at all.



i don't care about no pillow talking or nun of yo stupid friends 
wya ?
right next to you

i think i overdid it when training the other day, i'm hoping it's just really sore muscles and nothing else.

not really, just close to 'em.

my mommy had one its painful post op of course the worse part is sleeping in a recliner for 3-6 weeks
hmmm im thinking about getting one but yea bc i sleep on my stomach i almost used to wanna cry when i was pregnant lmao
lol the biggest part is keeping them from sweating under the incision so they wont get infected
oh &amp; you'll have to wear cotton bras but after about 3 weeks u can sleep in the bed



i'm back.

care that they are totally and completely irrelevant...?#windians #worldseries #cavsmania #monsters
don't been mention the b word.  they've had their chances to be good and they blew it big time.
that's an understatement. i wonder if haslam knows or cares what a joke this team is.
i don't even know.  he's the worst owner in organized sports.
but no more of this depressing talk. three more wins!!!



my friends just reminded me that there's a horrific picture of me blacked out at an after prom from high school somewhere on the internet

probs gonna kicked out of math bc of my cough
i honestly was scared to show up a few days because i had a runny nose and didn't want her to hear me sniffing..
i keep coughing randomly, im in the computer lab &amp; idk if i should even go???
were probably just doing notes, which you can get from someone
sounds like a plan to me.



sim city exactly. they want to force demand and development around choo choos. it wont work because we arent lab rats. #tcnt
look around the blue, green and northstar lines. it is already happening.
there is a long, long way to go. plus the bond market risks. then the other question is, is it even ethical?
why isn't this the same for road construction? it's all social/civil engineering. shouldn't pretend otherwise.
with roads its very easy to determine if you are supplying what is wanted, not forcing it.



if you fux with olivesi dont fux with you
you're a food scrub aren't you?
i just can't stomach them, i literally gag at the smell.
fair nuff dude but which olives have you tried? some olives are shitty af.
that's a good point, i'm not really sure. usually just whatever is offered or on something i accidentally order.



i think all pro sports should be like wrestling, where certain regular season games become title defenses where the trophy can change hands.
cavs-knicks would've been like the monday night raw after wrestlemania.
which leads to an all-star weekend royal rumble, where one player from each team competes in a giant game of 21 for the nba championship 
this is the best idea
.



really got my eye on this dude friend i used ta fw 2 years ago, fuck em that shit wasn't shit obviously. might be pushing the issue seen

kd really messes up the warriors chemistry
i agree. but it took the 2010 heat a month or two to look in sync.  so ima wait this one out before i say for sure
that's different tho... they didn't have 4 guys that are gotta put up 20 a night and 3 guys that take 20 plus shots a night
but....lebron......lol
lol lebron what?

it's 4:50 in the morning and i'm soo unbelievably irritated with myself bc i drank an energy drink at 9 for no damn reason
what were you thinking lol
i was trying to hang out and actually be social when everyone got home from closing ;p
well i mean, you can't be mad because those were some good intentions lol
but larry didn't even hang out with us so for me it just resulted in a headache &amp; upset tummy 



okay social media ethical types i have a conundrums i want to post something to point out obvious racist symbology and semiotics
i don't want the pain in my mentions or a pile on on this person but this shit looks like a cross btw rand/riefenstahl/ and the first myst
never mind read the tl and do not care no more
perfectly reasonable to say "here. this is problematic. figure out why."  you can't spoon feed us logic all the time.
it's a pop quiz for us. if we are paying attention to what you say at all, we should be able to get it. you're awesome.



warriors gotta 4 game losing streak... don't sleep

wonder how mad my mom would be if i just came home with a cat 
she'd tell you to keep it in the barn

not true



i really want to like my reisaru week fics but i feel like they aren't as good as i want them to be meh

my lil jasmine is the cutest thing ever
u guys make me so happy
u make us so happy &amp; sup proud 



so far, my experience with spacemacs hasn't been very positive.
one of the things i like about vim is that you don't have to do a bunch of configuring to be productive. spacemacs doesn't feel that way.
can't decide if like that as soon as it recognized i was in some file type (ruby, html, etc), it wanted to download syntax libraries for me.
i mean, i guess it's cool that it has a bunch of approved libraries that don't come pre-installed but it tries to get them upon relevance.
this happens on ubuntu too, right?  if you type `git` on a fresh install, i believe it recommends installing git.



warriors big are soft. warriors gotta fill the center position
that's why trade klay thompson for demarcus cousins
nope
why not.!?
just cause

nix the bow? what's left? also, at least we can party hard in casual cosplay.
nah everything is in about a half status and it's just not promising. casual cosplay may be the thing!

today is the day i get to open the new bag of coffee beans and i am very excited.
half the time i can't tell if i have an immense capacity for enjoying the little things in this world or i just totally need to get a life.
it's just that the beans smell so good.
definitely the bean-smell. i myself am a clandestine bean-sniffer.
well now you made it sound dirty, david

navy sec fo lost?



i'm about to say something here about #parenting and #life and you might have to stick with me for a minute.
i've been having some mental health issues since nola was born and you could say i'm not living my best life.
but nola is a "perfect" child. not really i know, but she's smart and cute and everyone immediately falls in love with her.
and i want her to look cute in her clothes because i don't.
i forgot where i was heading w this bc i got distracted but i know clothes particularly are a battle w kids sometimes



oh cool  #isles fan bashing by montreal media. god, fuck these entitled pricks
say what now?
attendance bashing
attendance has been pretty awful though. slow octobers are nothing new.
its every year no uptick til december



bruh most females be for everybody i've come to terms that's just how it is outchea

there is a difference between a girl and a woman tho
i'm aware that's why i said females i'm talking all ages 



if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. (1 cor. 3:18) #atheism #bible #god
yes your religion's hatred for intelligence, which sees right through it, is well known.
starting out the day being that judgmental can't be good friend.
says the judgemental one who views others as fools.
i haven't judged you. i quoted scripture. what happened was you read it and judged yourself. that's how the holy spirit works



both meulin and nepeta are good. i kinda like meulin a bit more but i couldn't choose a favorite
kankri is cuter and more interesting than karkat
stupid cat
cats eat birds better be careful, tubby
you don't know anytjing. fool .



hi lady ... how was your first night back at work???
it was good deb, thankfully my work is mental, not physical, plus they hired 2 new girls 4 my shift, so it's easier, less alarms
yay!!!! i'm soooooo happy for you 
feels good 2 be back &amp; not sitting on my ass at home. now i'm sitting on my ass &amp; getting paid for it, lol thanks deb, how r u?

3sooky5me
i just remember hearing like something making noises behind me and i couldn't move and was like shaking
yeah its pretty bad man usually you have ways to wake up



wow, this furore over the esc keys removal might last almost as long as the one about the headphone jackanyone remember that?
i don't think the headphone jack thing is going away. it's completely changed my future phone choice.
im certain apple wont change it back. so tell me: whys the included adaptor not good enough?
put simply: it's not user centered, at least to me. unless you want to look cool, wired earbuds are easier/cheaper/not easily lost
it still comes with wired earbuds in the box. (and if you want to use your own, theres an adaptor in the box too)



easily taking money line eagles this week
lets bet then 
20 straight up?
yea
bet no fraud shit



call me to talk #tinyhouse

that heart dropping moment you read about a murder on the same black as your parents live. then find out it was right next door.
i think you meant block.
when my phone is racist. 
all jokes aside, is your family okay?
there was this incident. and earlier this year my brothers house had a stray bullet hit 6 feet from his head.



the ultra boost gods answered my prayers 
the next roshes
chill that's the nmds 
boosts next
no way dawg. comfort never goes out of style



the mandela effect surrounding hannibal lecter in media is weird sometimes. like, he was never cool. he was always a nerd. who eats people.
"nuh-uh!" says that one dude i always run into w/ a anthony hopkins facemask t-shirt. "maybe in the show, but not in the movies!" uh-huh.
yeah, fullerverse hannibal was a nerd who went to fancy-jail for 3 because a boy wouldn't go out w/ him, but we saw the same movies, dude.
and in the books, hannibal lecter had six fingers on one hand and red eyes. he was a cartoon villain and an even bigger nerd. i can't even.
so like...does inego montoya ever get his revenge for hannibal eating his father?



swear to god if emma ricard sends me one more picture of her tits

i mean they nice but damn
ungrateful fuck

lazy chirp.
watch highlights. he plays now just like in anaheim. also, see carey price as an example of good. this ain't that. not close.
carey price is elite.  if you are looking to replace bernier with carey price, good luck with that.  .915 % career. .851% here.

i guess i could but i really don't have time. sounds like no defense was played. lol
that's true. i'm currently watching it. no defense was played but lots of records were set.



i have 2 different interviews this week and if both go well i don't know which job to pick 
flip a coin
will prob make a pros and cons list for each after my interview friday
or you can make a twitter poll
i would have to let twitter know all the pros and cons so they can make an educated decision



so, so you think you can tell heaven from hell, blue skies from pain.can you tell a green field from cold steel rail?a smile from a veil?
i have a pt that shaves his eyebrows &amp; reminds me of the wall.... #psychissues
oh wow! that film still gets me. been in my head because of the election and how close trump is to being a fascist.
it's a classic for sure! a clockwork orange too! those 2 movies' metaphors sum up all of my fears for this country!! 
yea it's roger waters and kubrick territory and it freaks me the fuck out!



we need political efficacy tests at polling stations. if you fail you can still vote, your vote just counts as 3/5 of normal peoples'.
then we're going against the voting rights act of 1965. that would be discriminating people because they're less knowledgeable.
so we need to change the law then.
no, because then we would be going against our founding principles. ya know... equality and natural born rights?
the trade off is that we have people who are actually educated voting. that is actually exactly what they had in mind.
there is no trade off when you are taking away people's rights, especially something as crucial as voting.



my family has been talking so much shit bc my hair is red like vallanse alv pinches envidiosos 
haha
pendejos lol
no les hagas caso
i cussed everyone out i need jesus
omg fr?? damnnn lol



it's funny how you hate sports and cleveland so much but yet you can go out and try to celebrate everything that's going on. fake.
what i been saying in my head all day about mass people tho
it's ridiculous
i saw people who a few months ago posted about how baseball is sickening to them, post "go tribe!" &amp; "world series!!" today 
 i guess it just comes with the territory
coach francola though 



it's this one grandma looking ass bitch that always looking at me weird i be so confused 
go to sleep 
girl fr i b wanting to know wtf is the reason for the looks tf

back to reality....
i had no idea getting back to reality would be this difficult!  #takemeback #nkotbcruise2016
im going to guess this is your 1st cruise .... its going to be rough lol
you are correct! regardless of how miserable i feel, i can't wait to do it again! 
this was 8 for me and #pcd (post cruise depression) is sorta like pregnancy brain you will forget all about it &amp; do it again

is kawhi still a system player? i'll wait.
you know they play 81 more games right?
they're 0-1 though. if they would have won though...
personally i would have said the same thing. 81 more to go.
1-0 bruh. no excuses. it's 1 game, but the league is on notice.
on notice? . hopefully your bench plays the majority of the minutes. u have the slowest starting lineup in the nba.






yay! i haven't watched last night show yet. but i'm super psyched.
it was really good. i'm loving #supergirl so much this season.
i've loved it too. esp tyler as superman. just which there wasn't less cat. hope calista returns often.
i agree. tyler is amazing as superman. i hope cat does come back often. that last episode with her, oh my gosh tears.
okay, i watched it &amp; i'd much rather kara be w/ mon el than james. 



i get the feeling that nintendo isn't on schedule for nx. i just feel they'd be willing to tell us more if they were.
then again only nintendo knows what nintendo is doing.
they may just be trying to build intrigue. they're could be teasing us along. to build hype.
but there's a danger there of not delivering on the hype. if you're gonna do this it has to be worth it.
once all the games and release date is announced, go hardcore on ads and have a superbowl ad
is nintendo cool enough to make a superbowl ad?



this is a friendly reminder that removing stuff like cd player, esc keys, headphone jacks, etc is not innovation.
. also people in 3rd world countries still use things like cds and headphone jacks because it's more accessible and affordable
arguably those people don't use the latest macbooks. i'm sure they've done their market research and know their customer.
hmm i meant more if someone from 3rd world who can afford to get a mac and tries to use it with other people...
...then that person will run into problems.
for example, i bought the macbook with a cd player because everyone back home still uses cds



power tripping and changing answers mid way through the event

my best romantic relationships are the imaginary ones i have with women on twitter. not sure if that's sad or a good thing.
seems like you could do better. 
so you think my imaginary twitter relationship with sarah is doomed?

thetigersez.

you mean the fact that jack is dead
yep
wasn't there something with her dad being named miguel also



i wonder if swift is important part of apple's car work. the stability concerns make a lot of sense for mission critical systems like cars.
ergg, skeptical of this one. many mission-critical systems are written in c or similar.
swift itself ain't that stable.
i don't think the programming language is the utmost concern with problems like these.
and  i'd be surprised if apple was using swift for anything like that at this point given how the syntax continues to change.
the argument that preventing subclassing would prevent a car crash is really tenuous.



11:11
i wished for a boyfriend .
it won't come true now cause you said it.....
prolly wasn't going to anyways :/
it's cool imma be a single pringle too so just love the shit outta it 
cool we can get through it together :-)

geez.. why are you so right ??

white girls singing about "niggers" stealing shouldn't have had to face any repercussions? .....
nope bc evidently it was 1) a famous vine they repeated 2) there was no malicious intent 3) it was all freaking jokes
they're not 5 year olds. them repeating what they heard isn't an excuse. it does not matter if there was malicious intent.
on that note you're absolutely right. but ppl fail to realize the intent of the video.. ultimately it's not that deep, people
a term used in the way that nigger was, is dense.
i agree to disagree sis 



way too much for my own good and he needs to visit my ass asap" tweet
luv u boi
&amp; i might hit the peoria date but 4sure lansing show!!
boi
and we'll wil out per usual
i'm sure we could work that out!



to update you on jamie herrington she has stated she took cough syrup which gave her the positive test. #wmma
interesting, if that is truly the case i swear nothing is safe anymore
it's a similar case to what jessica rakcozy went through a few years back.
i hear ya, while everyone is quick to cast judgement lately i have been holding back especially seeing how there can be screw ups
glad jamie came out with her side right after it was announced. hate to speculate what happened.
same, i really hope we haven't entered an era where we really have to question fighters and the labs for the truth



the warriors have 11 points off their bench. just run durant with them? he still gets his shots, and you don't mess with the top 5.
i don't think that would appeal to kd
how bout start with first 5 minutes then run two stars at a time for the rest of the first 3 quarters? there bench was turibl
i think klay should be the person on the bench if anyone
i think that makes sense, but i wouldn't want to mess with the team from last year's chemistry
i would. golden state: 



psa: attending escape 3 consecutive years makes you a real raver.
lol wut.. 3 years?  the og's go back to 2012

as long as you don't use the term real raver you're good

i was late every single day for 6 years. lol.
lmao are you serious omg did they never write you up?
like once, but i was their best employee. they never actually did anything 
 that's his reasoning he was like "im your best" and i was like bruh you were on your final warning what do you expect?!
the difference between him &amp; i: i was told i was the best employee and that's why my inability to be on time was overlooked



eating #keto is so much fun when friends who know you're on a "diet" see you order a spinach salad w/ steak/eggs/bacon/avocado/extra cheese.
haha mmm, sounds tasty, makes me want to eat "keto" as well &lt;
it's a tough adjustment (i still falter), but it can be an amazing lifestyle change.
well hang in there then, i have faith in ya!! i really should eat healthier tbh  i need to check that out, idk much about it
thanks! it really helps that i feel amazing when i adhere... but it's not for everyone. feel free to ask questions!
well thank you! hmm, i did a brief search on google before i went to work today and it said, "low carb diet," care to elaborate?

november is gonna be lit! traveling every weekend... arky game, medical school interviews in al and iowa, lsu game, fsu game. i'm excited! 
i lived in iowa for awhile when i was younger.... iowa city is decent, cold as shit in the winter... super freakin cold.
i've never iowa. never visited, never traveled through, nothing. the school i'm interviewing at is in des moines.
it would be a big adjustment for sure. i'm a florida baby. i would need like a life class on snow, ice, frozen pipes, driving...
yeah.. its alot different... and snow is on ground from like november thru march... feets of it... lol
my interview is november 14th so maybe i'll get to see snow!?!  



"jordan doesn't like anyone, he only tolerates us because he works with us".".
that's not true. you loved rodney.
the only thing i loved about rodney was his aid in developing the mcdonald's theory, regarding dating optimization.
"honey dip"
this rings no bells.
that's what you said when you spoke in his voice. or something similar. but i probably got it wrong, like everything

how on earth is your bf a warriors fan? i hope he's from there..
he is from there and moved here little over two years ago for work haha
haha okay, then he is a good man.
he just so happened to move here as cle sports (sans browns) are taking over the universe so it works well.

i'm just retweeting the best of the seahawks beat writers, players and bloggers and giving some own thoughts as well

ffx had one of the best video game soundtracks ever. hands down.
i must agree with you!
right! ffvii is a close second. after ffx-2 i didn't care much for any other soundtracks though. the series fell off for me.
ffvii is iconic so definitely and anyone that's a true fan of ffx knows that ffx-2 was a disappointment lol
about damn time they make a remake of ffvii, too. godddd, wasn't it? i still played it because i didn't waste $50 for nothing 
really tho it's only taken  a decade lol, but yeah i'm over here waiting for ffxv to drop. then it's rip lyfe



let's go, cubbies!  hey!  they were always my second team of there is any such thing being as big of a braves fan as i am...

oh yeah.  i was beside myself.  totally didn't see that one coming.  they're looking good, though.
i don't think anyone did. y'all indeed look better each week.
yep.  i couldn't be happier about the progress in seeing on offense.  the defense is just nasty!



another 11am kick..  you jinxed it a few weeks back!
 i take it back lol
too late! watch.. last home game vs tech gonna be 11am too
that'll probably depend on our win this weekend. but the way our season's going right now, i wouldn't expect anything else 
hey now!!! we totally beat kansas that says 2:30 kickoff right?!
 beating kansas should mean we get prime time @ 6:30

kid you not intook a course this summer whetr one of the assigments was to hug the rocks snd trees in cp
that's beautiful! it raises compassion, awareness and, i personally feel, it reduces stress.
not gonna lie to you, the lesson went over my head :( but i do talk to trees/ plants lol we're not at hugs yet
i think it's cuz i grew up around a lot of plants. my mom's living room was a mini botanical garden lol plants love to listen

 you will have good karma heading your way!



i think it's time tebow tried another sport. or i mean followed another dream.
i just sat through the last 3 innings of the game with an indians fan that also likes tebow. as in playing baseball 
because why?!
because i was signing a contract with a doula client. and the game was on. and then baseball and trash talk.
lol nooo why does he like tebow the baseball player?
because his baseball ideas are damaged, clearly. lol



love joel armia.  he gives his all. #nhljets

if google did that concept years ago when nexus began i'd likely still an an android user.

4 androids and problems. 4 iphones now and no problems. plus i haven't had to use a headphone jack since getting the 7 ;)
feeling you for sure. i tried ios once but it just didn't feel right.
yeah i liked it but too little too late to me. i am intrigued by fi thigh too if that could ever work with ios.



ciara left a toxic r'ship, found a new love who makes her glow, married him, now she's pregnant and she's a ho???
future is implicated in breaking up someone's 19-year marriage and he gets props and jokes???
ciara did everything right. after leaving a bad r'ship, she adjusted how she approached the next. she learned, grew, benefitted.
isn't that what those relationship books by oft-divorced men tell women, if they want to find a good man?
didn't ciara "think like a man and act like a lady?" isn't that what y'all say women should do to get the prize of a generous husband?
that is why we should do whatever we want, because no matter how it turns out they'll have a problem with it.



if i ever finessed you and you never did shit about it then you a complete bitch i promise you

last night was first night back to work since the hurricane.i'm feeling it. #nurselife

i did have a significant amount of damage. still out of electricity..i was loaned a generator this past weekend. blessing!
i'm so sorry, but i am glad you have generator now!! we lost a dock and a boat in the hurricane! downed trees, but no damage to hous
awww cathie.. i hate that.did you lose the new boat?
no! boat at folly is fine!! we lost a fishing boat at hilton head!



that "i just ran down two blocks and up three flights of stairs before 7 am" oh so fresh commuter feeling!
is that a good feeling?
well, it's ok as long as you made your train.
ah i see, good morning btw. hope your day turns out well 
we'll see what my sixth grade decides to do with themselves!  ah well, done. by 2:30, then home to write two papers!
sounds like loads of fun, i kinda miss working in education, kinda don't

i can't wait to beat your ass to a bloody pulp, zesser
wtf it's 7 a.m. you fucking psycho



just said he wants to poop on the floor wtf 
stop lying !!!
you're so disgusting i swear
that's you foooo all you do is shit all day 
2 can play that game
last time i recall , i didn't pose with my shit 



i am so sick of the daily whining and bitching coming from the trump campaign about the media. they're losing because america rejects him.
when all else fails, blame the media.
95% of the media is against him because 95% of the people who cover him and his campaign every day are disgusted-which seems natural
i wouldnt say that. but its reckless to foment insurrection against the media as an ad hominem.
that too. there are better ways to handle the media than attacking them. i'd give him more credit if he owned his own messes
however, this is why it's wise to perhaps not have this amount of dirt in your past if you're going to run for president

#digpharm
"emotional connections" assumes pharma getting in touch with and being comfortable with their own, real emotions.
lol - are you saying we all need therapy? (not untrue in my experience)
pharma needs therapy, for sure. i envision pharma as mr. cleaver. you know he loves you, but he's too distant to tell you.
just literally lol'ed in conference hall. 100% accurate.
happy to make the day a little brighter

love how obamacare opponents now feign concern that a fraction of 1% of people will see their premiums increase when the old plan was "die"
"man, this is really fucked up. i liked the old way better, when the free market allowed for premiums to increase *and* more people died."
yeah, it sucks that some peoples' premiums are increasing, but it's hard to pretend to be upset about that when you think large chunks of...
the population should have literally nothing and should just die or go bankrupt or some shit if they get sick.
sorry, back to shitty puns and baseball tweets

just had the weirdest interview ever. it's for a interfacilty paramedic position as a side job. heard this company was paying more...
so they call me while i'm at the grocery store. they asked "how long have you been a paramedic?" a: 9 years. then they asked..
you pull up to an auto accident with an unconscious patient but the car is on fire... what would you do? i answered and they asked...
..if i could be at orientation saturday morning lol. i'm like whoa, that was quick. i'm still trying to learn about the company.
they're either desperate or were really impressed. could be a little of both with an offer that quick
yea, they need paramedics bad. they just got a huge contract with a massive hospital system.

the most unrealistic thing about the episode nosedive is that it's public rankings and not ingroup. otherwise it's pretty spot on.
oh god, what if no one likes this tweet? what will i be then?

, you think hillary is wonderful. she isn't. but how could you know that? you don't live our lives or know her crimes.
"conservatarian" must mean that you only consume information that comes through chain emails or talk radio.
conservative libertarian. and you must be a hillary fan.
yep. because i don't get my info from chain emails or talk radio.
no, because you believe, however incorrectly, that you think for yourself. i'll bet you even think obama is a great president.
yep. i think he is the best president since the civil war not named roosevelt. because economics exist.

let's not go nuts, here. i was considering it for a while.
yes, no need. already nuts.



do you ever get the feeling that somebody just no longer wants to be friends with you.. so you end up slowly drifting away..
all the time...
the sad reality of it is it happens way to often then it should.
just because nobody picks up the phone.
&amp; it's kinda funny bc everyone is always on their phone. it makes it worst when u realize they're just straight ignoring u.
like i said, my phone number hasn't changed. it's a drag but a part of life.

if you update macos to sierra and your external monitor resolutions get completely messed up, just pay $16 for switchresx app. #timeismoney
im confused on this one. why not just change the setting? seems like it would take less time than an app
i even installed the newest version that they just pushed out ... and it didn't fix so i got the app which brought it back.
interesting. ive had so many issues with those apps before that ive given them all up
i would never install an app for something this stupid ... but my options were really small text or blurry text on scaled.
fair enough that makes sense. i guess this is just the 1st time ive seen an app like that actually solve a problem :/

it would be! yeah i hate ga shows! never been to houston but i know i will fell safer there than southside
agree though houston would probably be better than south side

something about blonde hair and blue eyes that just catches your attention.

the homeland
don't forget about the hidden hitler switch that stays lowkey until they get mad at you
whatchu mean
they all posses an evil

i desperately need a new mackbook pro! waiting for the #appleevent !!
just got my custom made one 2 months ago
you did!!  i checked their website mafe info about it
no i mean i got the 2015 edition. i didn't know they'll release new laptops
oh! that's too bad. i think they will release the new ones with colors, like they did with 2015 macbooks.
hmmm interesting upgrade! however, silver still rocks on those macbooks.



it's so early to be ranting but everyone thinks i'm the happiest person in the world because of the way i act and how i'm always happy
like everyone likes me because of it and think i'm really nice and everything but in reality i'm like the most miserable person ever
u ok man 
i'm never ok :-)
if u need to talk i'm not doing anything rn 
i mean if you want just dm me



strangely, i noticed that the voices and "mouthing" in #dragonballxenoverse2 is out of sync.  very odd, to a point where all blame is on....
the editors or whoever is in charge of adr, piecing the voices together.  had to bring it up though cuz its somewhat bothersome
been seeing that on footage that's out there. i have a feeling lines were recorded when the game was still being developed,
so they may not have had time to do proper adr.
agreed.  they couldve waited a little longer, but then again, players would rather hav it soon then wait half or a whole year for
the english dub



i actually studied and tried on the math test today and i still failed 
don't study like me
fuck you dick
\_()_/
i hate you fagget
u love me bitch



still waiting for 1 person - just 1! - to present an alternative policy on #syria to status quo, which clearly isn't working.i'm waiting.
#pt: critique all you want, but pushing the current track is illogical &amp; offering nothing but critique is academically immature.#syria
saw some further critiques of an enhanced u.s. assertive role in #syria in past 36hrs.but still no alternative policy plans.im waiting.
#pt: if you critique w/o advocating some form of evolved #syria policy, you by default support the status quo, which has resolutely failed.
#pts: if you see [counter-]terrorism as the principle u.s. security interest in #syria, todays policy is comprehensively *not* working.
today's policy is not working when it comes to counter-terror because us is backing islamic extremists! what do u expect?



tomorrow is a huge day.. i'm not ready x.x;
you'll be fine 
hopefully
one step at a time :3 that's all ya gotta take. it's gonna be worth it.
not exactly a "one step at a time" thing. i'm not talking about the con.
true true. and i know. i remember. :3



sorry reip
ehat
im sorry nhi
what r u sorry for im scared
i hope reis dakimakura is him lying peacefully in his coffin
i hope rei daki wont be real



can't. feel. my. arms. 
someone call 9-1-1 this man can't feel his arms hahahah
i wish this wasn't so true haha
almost as bad as not having arms hahah
that will forever be one of my favorite memories from high school 
same  instantly thought of that when you said you couldn't feel your arms lmao



curious what everyone thinks about slack? i've always thought it could be a neat place for ongoing customer service. #fatbitchat
i use it primarily to communicate with co-workers.  never thought of it as a cs solution.  interesting idea.
i love it for co-worker communication. always wondered what a support channel might look like.
with a busy enough channel, you'd better like that popping notification noise!
i just like the idea of a team being involved for quick response rather than needing to funnel from social.
i'm all about a quick response.  i'd be curious to see how a ticket system would function in this regard.



if the indians win, i may actually have to do a pub crawl in cleveland!
i hope the #indians win today in #standingrock #nodapl :)
naturally, i should like chicago. however, i just can't stand the despicable cubs owners.
well, i'm not talking baseball. i'm talking real indians in north dakota.people as mascots = bad
that cultural misappropriation is deplorable. the situation in nd is even worse, may contaminate stuff for generations!
it's just like how the cherokee removal went down. this country has never changed.but hey, go #indians and #seminoles. #fdup



i really wanna drive out here but i'm shook. this whole other side of the road thing and crazy la drivers. madting sadting
like i've def nearly died in uber twice this week lol
lol.worse than a nyc cabbie? i know it is the same side of the road as the uk but driving in the caribbean is a suicide mission
nyc are real gs, these la ones are just a bit mad, oh know, driving in the caribbean is a death wish with all those cliffs lol
omg yes ....fr tho..the cliffs.  and the potholes feel like some kinda monster rising up from  road to bite your tires
and the whole no street lights thing in some areas. naaaaah thanks



i feel very sorry for the lambs in south america. but this isn't really mariah's fault. i trust her, i know she will go there soon.
yes it is sad. i am still not sure what exactly happened.
i don't know what happened either. but i just saw some people insulted her and don't wanna be lambs anymore. that sucks !
yes, sad. hopefully given time, they will feel differently
we'll see. but i doubt it.
you may be right



blessed.
heyyyy pig
hi
wyd
headed to work.
have a good one my nigga



i use to be on 54th and gaskill with them killas
from 74th and mac
i use to be on 64th but up the street on that 1 way lol
most wild shit i ever seen happened on 55th and international
i bet lol
yeah i be out late night too when all the wild shit happens



1.  did you use pseudonym on all emails?2.  did you every send classified information via email using a pseudonym?
3rd question: doesn't this indicate u r also corrupt &amp; helping ruin the democratic party? potus, wall st controlled.
how does sending her random holiday greetings do that?  explain, i am curious.
that will take many words, far 2 many 4 twitter. let's see if i can stay awake &amp; get it written. holiday don't matter
i am open minded on this.  but i just don't see any actual evidence yet.
do u believe this is coup rather than election? is hrc being installed or elected? critical thinking &amp; logic r needed



from a paper i'm reading:"surprisingly, the scalability and performance of exim are significantly dependent on the file system."
"surprisingly"?!?!whomever wrote that: you're fired.
it's relevant but it's just "duh?"
honestly surprised that something like lmdb isn't the default backend  these days
oh for exim? fighting corruption is like 99% of writing a prod mailserver though
or at least for the operator heh



got added to a twitter list called "high-volume" and now i'm worried that i tweet too much
i feel like my sense of "high volume" is really thrown off by the number of new york media types i follow.
true they are out of control
i know what you mean though--i assume every twitter list add is an implicit unfollow.
tbh i don't care that randos put me on lists. listen, don't listen, twitter was arguably more fun at 400 followers anyway
and hey, now that we have muting and the algorithmic timeline, god knows if anyone's listening.



i don't like sitting around all day  need to get my butt back in school
i can see that you need a piece of meat
 you kno i went gay gay
nuh... lol i know you, you like hard stuff and dykes ain't hard enough to satisfy you
i'm crying .. why you ain't do your 10 toes challenge
ima do it when i'm off  wyd this weekend



*ned and i listening to childish gambino*me: i don't get this, do you? ned: not really
what don't you get about childish? he's just clever word play 
"girl why you mufasa"
literally one of his worst lines, but he says before that "girl why is you lyin" but words it as "lion". plz ignore that song lol
oooooooooooooooooh!!!!! 
it's a line from a freestyle that he put into a real song that fits the beat, but is literally so bad 



trying to be more communicative with people and i'm not sure it's working out well for me.
pretty sure an awful lot of people like me better when i don't actually speak to them.
speak verbal or speak twitter?
online, mostly. although this has sometimes pertained in my outside life as well. =p
do you want some advices from me?
i don't think there's any shame in being a better orator than a conversationalist...



operation "sell low on lacy" has been a colossal failure this morning... stay tuned for operation "hold lacy and pray" this off-season.
what were the offers?
basically early 2nd round 2017 (some late 1st) valuation is what i was throwing out.
of course i don't have a second in the league i'm in with you,  and you're my only real competition at the top ;)
so much truth imo
that team is my biggest surprise.  i hated it when i drafted it last year,  and it ended up crushing.



wanna tell you how beautiful you are but you're nowhere to be found
she ain't shit
it's a song lol
liessssssssss
spooky black - without u listen to it
okay okay i was kidding dude 



to be like the 2013 lakers after 1 game. they still have to adjust.
chemistry &gt; talent, i wish your team the best
yeah this spurs team continued from where they started last season while gsw started from scratch.
i'm not a spurs fan, but kawhi leonard is such a beast all-around guy. kd needs to be more all-around like him in gsw.
kawhi to me is the mvp this season. he could've been 1 last yr if curry never improved.
true, i respect him so much. plus i heard kobe mentored him in the offseason



my take on new rule - doesn't go far enough. cup drivers will still dominate nxs. but happy they are out for chase races #smallvictories
and the dash for cash races too
yes - although most (or some) of those are stand-alones anyway
do you think this wouldve happened anyway if it was another driver stinkin it up like kyle has recently?
yes
agreed...wonder how many that call n complain today wither dont or refuse to realize it



lidia has me straight dead right now ive missed her so much



i wanna be part of this
thank you for ur bomb filming skills
dude lolllll  we gotttttt you!!!!
lol on to bigger and better things in life right

it fucking hurts to even lay my head down. god.

do not fall. this is a no fall zone



everyone needs to read/listen to you are a badass by jen sincero...inspiration af! 
i have had this book for awhile now but have yet to read it
you need to! it's the best thing that's ever happened to me (dramatic, i know), but it is good lol
haha okay i'll check it out and let you know my thoughts on it
please do. i'll be interesting to hear a guys perspective.
someone told me that i should skip the first half of the book and just start after like chapter 11. what is your take on that lol?



hhsur pep rally's ain't shitur student section ain't shitur sports ain't shit do u even have spirit days besides botb ? i'm curious .
okay stop  thats wrong
your football team wins sometimes .. the only thing worth being acknowledged is your basketball,wrestling, and water polo
every sport at hemet is better then wv ?
ya'll act like we ain't shit because our football team is the best .. but neither is yours lmao
isn't *



take some alone time each morning to meditate or write or walk, whatever it is for you, just be with yourself before you start your day.
that sounds like an awesome idea. i used to write a lot before, then life happened:(
it's hard but makes a big difference! i've started setting my alarm 20 mins earlier to journal a few pages in the morning 
yeah i've been debating a lot in my mind about it. there's so much i have in my head and i just want to let it out.
highly recommend the journaling. just the act of writing those thoughts down is such a release &amp; you'll find so much clarity
thank you so much for the advice. i truly appreciate it.



i definitely don't like coconut water
it's the best 
:( it's sucks but i'll still drink it cause it's healthy
lol not everyone likes cause there's really no flavor
it tastes kind of sour, like sour milk and water combined lmao
hahahah never thought of it like that



it's october r: like i said golden state is not a lock to win it all
still no lock
it isn't like you said then lol. it's just one game
exactly so they shouldn't be considered a lock neither....
nah y'all gonna just critique everything the warriors do in the regular season like it even matters. "i told you" lmao
not at all i just think other teams can compete



due to a pending deployment with no internet, i've been forced to start actually downloading porn to bring with me like a caveman
dear lord, what 3rd world country are you being sent to?
the ocean and then the middle east somewhere and then the ocean again
bless your heart, they put you on a boat didn't they?
yes 
be strong



my last draw meet w/kids: this 15 year old girl looked through my iphone texts right in front of my friend....like bruh u dont do that....
what the... that's so rude and creepy???
it was so......creepy and the whole time she was trying to get my attention but in a very wrong way
:-( hopefully w age restriction it'll be less creepy?? like wowowow that was so invasive and over the line
i had one meet up on my birthday...and there were at least 30 ppl laughs.....
wah that sounds like fun and wow such a huge group omg how did you guys all fit in one place



i'm off today so i'm going to take like 50 naps until ava get home from school
swear you me smh
lol
already got my nap scheduled out
i'm about to roll over now...i'm tied
lol enjoy



love it and him.
who?
the zaddy outfit.
does he know this?
no... i'm shy. lol
tell him



i just started watching shameless and omg
hate that show lol
whyy
the story is like way too confusing lol
no it's not but then again i'm still on season 1
on top of it all that show is just weird lmao



u know how some ppl window shop online by adding items to their cart &amp; then erasing it all? i just did that... with taco bell. #mylifeissad
yo i got you one day on some taco bell, this broke my heart lol
btw i need to get that course number for you! in glad you tweeted me!
i appreciate that by the way
it's mc1100e - digital tools with dale blasingame
thank you 



discovered the dark side of twitter in a hashtag game filled w humor, then stuffed w antisemitism and racism. i wish for equality &amp; respect.
the same people must moonlight as trolls on my youtube vids. apparently i am jew who is working for the illuminati. who knew?!
i ignore trolls except on halloween. then, i give them candy. i learned they have their own issues and one of them isn't me.
i admit i play with my trolls. i can't help it.



my troll playing generally involves me grading their comments w/ solid advice on how to include more humor/intellect



my conference for my english is tomorrow instead of halloween. i could've stayed in vegas until monday :(
if only i didn't have to work sunday smh
 off
let me borrow some points
did you use your call sick frees? i got you i'm at 0 i think
how do i check to see if i have any?



i just bought a cheese grater off a registry for a friend's wedding. in the note section i put "i hope you have a grate time together"
soon to be (former) friend, i imagine
it was either that or a jug of syrup. the wedding is saturday so the list was pretty slim by the time i got to it today
would've gone with the syrup.
at one point i was getting them a spatula and a berry strainer, so yeah, i shouldve snagged the syrup.
wedding registers baffle me. why don't couples already have these things and why all of a sudden need them when married?



players like simmons and leonard are tough...pushes back against the soft label the spurs have
all facts, but i've never heard that rhetoric in regards to the spurs.
"too many europeans", not enough dog in them, blah blah been a off and on critique of the team for a while in hoop circles
i guess i've heard those opinions tossed around. never really equated it to them being soft though, but i feel you.
europeans always accused of that...kg himself would target euro players for being soft
true. i thought pop, david &amp; duncan were enough to disregard that label. they're "boring" if u don't know , soft is crazy tho.



wake up seeing all these hot takes on the warriors..yea it's one game
#warriors are going to miss the playoffs. durant messed up their chemistry! lol #nba #hottake
lmfao! dude i'm seeing all types of stupid shit like that
me too lmaoooooo
i'm not even the hugest basketball fan but this stuff pisses me off its like are they that slow
if they are 15-25 halfway through you could make that argument. but one game vs. the 2nd best team in the conference? hahaha



good morning and god bless 
good morning gerald 
morning sis
i got 4 hours, sad
tragic *your voice*
up yet??



i just smoked this cause it'll have me sleep soooo good
lit...
literally
same 
aw cheers
cheers  hope to see you around sometime soon!



really debating on applying to the prison. the pay is so good, and i already got my connect to get me in. but is the risk worth it ?! 
im on the sameeeeee boat
such a risk... like is it worth it ?
i'm sayinggg  but that check is crazy too i'm here doing a pro &amp; cons list about it
lmao deadass! i just finally got my man to give me the thumbs up to even work there lol. fuck it, i think ima go for it
do it baby g ! and if it isn't working out then there's always other options &amp; opportunities



nba &amp; world series champions? by way of toronto? i can't take that kind of pain.
the cubs will win it
i don't know.... i feel it might just be cleveland's year lol
nah chicago wins game 2 then 3 and 5 and wins it in 6 lol
lmao! guess we'll see... is it 2-2-3? or 2-3-2?
2-3-2. the weirdest "home field advantage"



i real life need a blunt lol
man
mann burn it lol
i'm tired
stop being a weenie lol
nah man i'm sleepy



definitely putting money on ryan. 
i would too tbh, even though i really shouldn't because east coast.but fuck it, ryan seems way stronger.
it would be a good match for sure. ryan's on a hotstreak but cosmos slays gods for fun so it would be nuts.
i think cosmos has a good matchup against traditional top teams, but any sort of unconventional strategy trips him up.
it would be interesting to see if he could adapt to ryan's playstyle, but idk.
yeah, like, who has chun experience?



trying to be more communicative with people and i'm not sure it's working out well for me.
pretty sure an awful lot of people like me better when i don't actually speak to them.
speak verbal or speak twitter?
online, mostly. although this has sometimes pertained in my outside life as well. =p
do you want some advices from me?
... i just don't want to appear as if i'm here for my own aggrandizement either. and i do like people on here.



na dead ass i'm a do a horoscope thread sometime soon i think i got all my signs down now y'all know i been practicing this shit lmao

do u know the price of my team?
no i dont buy it. how much mut for 50k mt?
3:1 ratio cool?
ya, is it cool if i buy the card tomo when i get on? wont be on tonight.






big difference between discerning a ball/strike in baseball and fumble/catch in football.
theres more to look at in football. in baseball, a computer as you see on tv, can do it instantly.
ball/strike is a black and white call. two states. fumbles and catches are not.
black and white calls should be decided by technology. especially when a baseball is moving 80-105 mph.
a fumble and catch would be more if-then-else type deal. with lots of branching paths.



5. celebq from merriam-webster: what word should mean the opposite of what it means?(forme condone, always felt it should mean the opposite)
technically, "awful" used to mean the opposite of what it means today. used to mean: "full of awe"  #themoreyouknow
really???? #themoreiknow
really. think about it: awe. full.
: inflammable. on that note, i also contribute: infamous.
i followed the armadillo



work is way too easy today lmao
where you work?
walmart
cashier or?
stocking/inventory
ahh that's easy. if i were you, i'd lowkey finesse a bag of chips and eat that shit.



sometimes i think my mum's a bot, then not, then i think she's a bot then not
maybe she's just delusional?
i want to wait and see on this i've felt so similar but i have no proof
whenever i try to explain something controversial to her she never gets it and she's a smart woman -
i mean what kind of human can be this ignorant?
does it seem intentional? like she intentionally keeps herself ignorant so she doesn't have to actually think about things



y'all gon make me take a shot of apple crown ain't no apple crown? that's all cap
i'm gon talk that shit that niggas wanna hear. nigga drinking lean like he drinking beer

tity ripped that tape.



i wish it was socially acceptable to meet someone and say "hey, i want to know you lets me friends"
knowing you, youd probably find a way to make that socially acceptable 
so you think i should go for it?
do it! id be friends with someone that did that!
if he ends up thinking i'm creepy will you talk to him and tell him im not thaaaat creepy?
totally!



if you care about me, you've done a shit job showing it  you didn't take chances
i'm sorry jeffery i luuuuuuv u

i watched "hate rising" last night. highly recommended. the corridor scene with ramos and the trump camaign says it all. #nevertrump
i dvred it. haven't finished watching it yet. was at the point where he was interviewing the second guy.
the weirdo nazi groups are as expected - it's the people who might pass for normal who are shocking.
exactly! the "shirt and tie, white nationalist" as the one lady put it. they have a better chance of recruiting more people.
it's astonishing anyone is that stupid and obtuse on purpose in this century.
eh, a lot of these folks aren't stupid though. it's about fear. they're afraid of "change".

is kawhi still a system player? i'll wait.
you know they play 81 more games right?
they're 0-1 though. if they would have won though...
personally i would have said the same thing. 81 more to go.
1-0 bruh. no excuses. it's 1 game, but the league is on notice.
but the bench is prolly the best in the league. but again. its early.



yes the spurs thumped the warriors but stop saying they won't win this or that. still so much ball to play
only 1 game smh

my heart is sad
i know this seems like it is about a boy but it's because i saw a dog on campus tonight and it wouldn't let me touch it
omg this is the same dog we saw that one night on the garage i see it every day
her name is presley it's decided and i just want to love her. like why hang out around a school if you don't like people bro
i'm currently prepping to kidnap her
i just want to feed her mashed potatoes and show her affection



it's crazy how modern presidents have this kind of celebrity status among society now
they are now literally like puppets of the country, just for show

uhhh what no way that is wild! bout to not sleep and try to get as close as i can to the end lol
how close did you get? hahah



thinking more today about diversity in tech companies &amp; how they could really benefit from sensitivity training. heck, all companies could.
we hear most about sensitivity training for companies interacting with the general public: hospitality, healthcare, etc. why not all?
it's not as tho marginalized ppl aren't also consumers or potential hires for companies. everyone should learn to understand inclusivity.
if a game studio is going to be made up of all white dudes the very least they could do is get trained on non white dude issues.
's company did sessions on diversity issues, as has vox! agreed, super worthwhile.
. trying to think of ways to bridge the diversity gap. people with privilege need exposure. mandatory training could help.



what climate change?
the thing that flooded you out of your house...that climate change....
co2 made that front stall over my house? please explain how that works.
the more moisture in the air the more intense the weather...simple science
then why no category 3 hurricanes hitting land since 2005? not so simple.
you should be glad they are not hitting land, they are still there, james



i finally figured out what i'm going to be for halloween so at least i have that going for me rn.

they can't fire you for that?
they petty and don't value education like they make it seem in orientation.. my walmart petty asf 
no your manager doesn't value it but the company still does. you'd have to contact someone in a higher position or hr



doesn't forget about me this morning 
nah ima stay home 
i would love to but my mom would kill me 
i did the other day 
lmfao wow 
you almost ready?



so why hasnt the us of a added pins the the credit chip cards
some do have the option, but it's rare. seen a couple of customers at work that have to pin with their chip cards.
its just, ever since i can rme we here, the credit card by default had the pin number same as the debit  which can be changed.
usa is weird. none of us understand it either.
oh well,  cant always be on top!
true that



man they're using that "corrupt politician that has ever run for office" up the kazoo. repeat a lie often enough &amp; ppl will believe it.
that's been trump's entire life and campaign.
it has. repeat repeat and repeat again. and his sheep believe it all.
he repeats x100, media repeats his repeats x100. it's exponential lying on a grand scale.
and a lot of it will stick even after proven false. the media must shoulder a huge part of the blame for trump. huge! lol
the only good thing is if there are any fence setters anymore, it might help. msm created trump &amp; is responsible.



interesting. catching up on internal sops in the office this morning.  we've a new health and safety policy for working alone in the field.
is it to not point the lasers at yourself?
yes! do not point the lasers at yourself or anyone else.  ;p
anyone else? uncoooooool.
i actually did point the laser at myself a few weeks ago and could see a signal from the bone in my finger. how cool is that?
that is fricking badass, no lie



lady's, there is nothing wrong with acting like a woman, liking girly things, and having woman like mannerisms.
i'm sorry, but there are so many things wrong with this tweet.
spelling wise or me talking?
both.
well you follow me. never forced you to do so. so please if you don't like my content. feel free i won't be hurt
was never worried about hurting your feelings. just don't want you to embarrass yourself with your own ignorance.



would rather be eating coconut shrimp

my roommate had a date with someone last week, and he said "idk, man. i took her to shoot pool, and she just wasn't feeling it, i guess."
he's pretty upset about it and can't seem to figure out that shooting pool wasn't a very good idea for a first date
that would be an awesome first date what even?????

no we were at that kids house w the pool and the tent and the speaker lol



is there a reason people tend to choose romantic partners that they look like they could be related to? like, a scientific reason
it's weird, buddies.
they want to have offspring that look like them because they want to pass off their genes both phenotypically and genotypically
makes sense to just breed with relatives then, que no
i mean they also don't want a child with extra toes we're programmed to not want to mate with persons we have known since birth
makes sense. what about gay couples tho



love seeing everybody's photos of the 1975!!! really hoping to photograph them again in november!!! 
then people started selling $40 tickets for over a $100 and i can not afford that!
i really want to shoot both dallas and houston dates!

im guessing  its future's fans still butthurt that she  found a good man.and didnt come crawling back to him..
yep. that is something i don't understand.
admittedly  i dont  know a lot about her. but if she makes  russell happy thats enough  for me
exactly. i love seeing people happy and in love. i have no clue why anyone would be against that.
its an ego thing.

i think maybe i shouldn't invest in people i can't hug at the end of an evening and feel great about it.
hold on. not everyone wants to be hugged.
i guess but ice got to say a platonic hug feels great. what if i just want to hug the counter party and they can opt in? 
no. you are in a power position and many women may be uncomfortable refusing.
this is exactly what many women are trying to talk about. imagine an lp hugging you. or a federal judge. you ok with that?
i'd love it actually! i hugged 3 men tonight. i mean this in a totes platonic way. normally i agree with you 100% but maybe not here



curiosity was killing me, so i am at the bk alamo drafthouse rn, and (predictably enough) it is so wonderful i could cry.
but did you get any kool stuff at century 21
no, but wow is that building full of places we all hate ourselves for secretly loving.
there's even a brooklyn roasters in c21! (ahh i can't wait to go see moonlight at ad)
i just want moonlight to play somewhere below 14th st that isn't angelika.
i was surprised at how few theaters it was at last weekend, but think it should be pretty easy to see this weekend.



i haven't gotten nudes in so long that i didn't even know how to respond when some guy sent me one lmao
send one back lmao
lmaooo all i said was "nice"
i'm gonna get he didn't reply ?
no he replied, he even sent another one 
ohhhh well then 



i need a new back, apparently. or maybe i should just stop lifting heavy stuff.
i got a new lower back 14 years ago...
oh. i need one! or i just need to cut out that piece of muscle that i keep having spasms in! what am i, 200 years old? :)
lol. i killed a few discs, had to replace em.
oh. uh oh. from working out?
naw, lifted wrong. had a defect in my spine i didn't know about... so at a real young age, had it all fixed.



my escape ticket seller just flaked on me!!still looking for 2 single saturday tickets to escape
saturday?? booooo
friday is extinct though !
sneak in!!!
lol i'm not a pretty asian girl like you that can just walk in 
i mean  do you follow the "rave exchange socal buy/sell" on fb?

wowwww k 
no no no
it's okay, cause like the wise aaliyah once said "if at first you don't succeed, dust yourself off and try again"
that's right



daleks are so loud and scary, most effective alarm ever. scary as shit
did it exterminate your sleep?

lol still sounds scary
it screeches "exterminate" and does really loud shooting sound effects and it wakes me up in a panic



show: "the blacklist" this man was on the most wanted list but turns himself in to the fbi, but you'll have to watch to see why. he so smart
movie: "tears of the sun" navy go to save a doctor in africa but she don't want to leave all the ppl behind so they basically go to war.
show: "how to get away with murder," i don't have to even explain this one, you just sleep if you don't watch it but catch up on netflix.
lol i gotchu i'm bout to start watching this
warning, they have gay scenes in it! lol
lol what about the blacklist



are more than 20 teams going to stl?
i live 1.5 hours away, but don't have a team. might come spectate this weekend though if i don't get a last-minute squad.
dude if shirts are dope there i may get you to pick me up 2 i can paypal. lemme know 
absolutely! wish you'd come though so we can hang bb.
i know i know bb :( going to see bae this weekend. we're trying to come to an event soon
hopefully there are more that i can go to. absolutely can't justify flying to cali when i have bills to pay. haha



as a sox fan to root for the cubs would be like being a michigan state fan who starts rooting for michigan. it doesn't happen
yeah but michigan and michigan state are in the same conference just like hmmm the sox and indians
i want to keep the world series in the al central, shows the sox play in the best division in baseball
makes the sox fans look like fools alway rooting for their dvsn winnr. every dvsn winner since '10 has used the sox as a doormat
sox weren't the doormat in 2012 or even this year, if the sox's season ended after april they'd be the best team in the al
cleveland was 11-8 vs the sox. 2012 tigers were 12-6. looks bad to be rooting for the teams that run you over consistently



my conference for my english is tomorrow instead of halloween. i could've stayed in vegas until monday :(
if only i didn't have to work sunday smh
 off
let me borrow some points
did you use your call sick frees? i got you i'm at 0 i think

i'll come see you on thursday 



discovered the dark side of twitter in a hashtag game filled w humor, then stuffed w antisemitism and racism. i wish for equality &amp; respect.
the same people must moonlight as trolls on my youtube vids. apparently i am jew who is working for the illuminati. who knew?!
i ignore trolls except on halloween. then, i give them candy. i learned they have their own issues and one of them isn't me.
i admit i play with my trolls. i can't help it.



but i thought dr. phil said there are always two sides to a pancake.

#hereiamwithher. voted for our #hillary yesterday. shimmy, tears, for my grandmothers.
well, expect a lot more tears after we end up in more endless wars.
did my part in halliburton's war. still, #hereiamwithher. says a lot : my support is not just about her gender.
i didn't like that war either....she's a george bush in a pantsuit.
i disagree. she's shrewder, and with tighter parameters. think she's right of obama, but no bush.
well, we'll see. mark my words. if she wins, we're in for a hell of a lot of war all over a regime change in syria. bad news.



just finished the last episode of that 70s show! now what am i going to do with my life??
i finished it last week and honestly i still don't know what to do with myself
like there isn't anything else to watch on netflix
no you pretty much just need to start over
ok time to watch another 200 episodes
yes that's the spirit!!! honestly it was better the second time

i'm still waiting on all this free healthcare, college, housing, and money from the government, that everyone says us native americans get.
yeah, i could use a bit of that too
yeah, i really didn't care for paying the penalty for not having health insurance when i was laid off last year
the healthcare situation is actually better than when we were kids. but still not the best. er visits over hastings visits
man, i can't count how many times we had to drop someone off at hastings, usually in the middle of the night.
long drive to get told your std isn't a pregnancy



trying to be more communicative with people and i'm not sure it's working out well for me.
pretty sure an awful lot of people like me better when i don't actually speak to them.
speak verbal or speak twitter?
online, mostly. although this has sometimes pertained in my outside life as well. =p
do you want some advices from me?
you're welcome to offer it, at least - but i'll offer a caveat first.



my dear, my sincerest condolences.  sending you love and light.
legit thought of you the other day. appreciate it, love. how are you?
aww how sweet is that. i'm okay, wbu?
i'm okay, ty.
absolutely. still not sleeping i see.
lol, barely.



@gnoccofritto honoured that you can waste a rt on my tweets! peek at my timeline for great photos, images, art.
but every now and then there is a photo i find interesting
you're full of it i have great photographers on my timeline!
most of those people are re-posting the work of others.
some of them are dead! good luck with that! i'm very selective.
you could be even more selective.



my cat spit up for the very first time yesterday. she's over 2 years old so i was wondering when that shit would start. 
how weird, mine did too. but i'm not sure if it was a hair all or if she just ate too fast
i think she had too many treats. damn kids. lol
the dog kept eating all the cats food, so when i figured it out and fed her, she inhaled her food.  5 minutes later *ack*
ooops
yeeeah. major fail. hubs put cat food on the kitchen floor, i kept putting dog in kitchen to save her from ear-yanking kid

today is one of those days where i wanna say "fuck it", go home, and become a burrito.
be a burrito
the minute 3 pm hits, i will turn into a burrito. kinda like in cinderella. she turned into a burrito right? 
a really shitty burrito, sure.
....i kinda want a burrito now.

yesss hahaha that's the solution, just watch it over &amp; over

how many award-winning dishes or tasting menus have cooked green pepper? probably zero.
like...bell pepper? or any?
green and cooked. tastes like the 80s.
saison did a gourmet version of a jalapeo popper once. that was green and cooked.
i mean cooked green bell pepper not jalapeno. overpowers &amp; kills meat dishes/sauce. other peppers/colors/fresh/sparingly ok
yeah, that's why i asked. it's often a filler vegetable. maybe in new mexico?



me?
mmhmm
i haven't nutted since last wednesday /thursday. i'm on lock down by bryant as far as that goes lmao. he said i gotta hold it
i know!!i wanna edge, but i know if i do imma hit the wrong pressure point and explode!
fuck that, i'm gonna edge lmao... at least i'll get a small bit of relief without nutting. i just need to stroke my dick
lol i'm scared.

i'm over here fighting for javale...and then he goes out there and gets banged on the second he checks in
because getting dunked on equates to being a productive player right? lol... okay
did someone recently dunk on u? lol all i'm saying is i'm routing for the guy to be a rim protector
olajuwon got dunked on, bogut get dunked on. getting dunked on =/= being bad rim protector. still undecided on javale tho
i can't put olajuwon and javale mcgee in the same convo..i don't care what we are talking about...but iq plays a big role into this
sure. i agree with that. can't agree with varejao seeing court before mcgee - even with better iq, he brings nothing to table









get tf out my bed
you get tf out of my bed
last time i checked, you sleep in my bed
brb getting dad to call upd

more than half the roster has the catch and shoot badge. and yes the way teams perform in real life affect the video game
i'm not good at the game anyway 
i know. i've witnessed the bs. "how you dunk?" i tell you and you go underneath the basketball and shoot
i already forgot how to dunk tbh. i get good at it and then forget



discovered the dark side of twitter in a hashtag game filled w humor, then stuffed w antisemitism and racism. i wish for equality &amp; respect.
the same people must moonlight as trolls on my youtube vids. apparently i am jew who is working for the illuminati. who knew?!
i ignore trolls except on halloween. then, i give them candy. i learned they have their own issues and one of them isn't me.
i admit i play with my trolls. i can't help it.



but agreed on the advice.



all have a theology, what we think to be true of god, &amp; a creed (written or unwritten), what we say to be true of god. what informs it?
excellent question. what do you believe the answer to be?
sola scriptura.
i believe it to be the objective truth. (not my interpretation of it) but it stands safely outside my subjectivism, &amp;...
it's what i keep going back to. yes god reaches thru to me by experience &amp; other means, but scripture is my home base.
like the bumpers in a bowling alley! 



good morning #cowboysnation 

hiiiiii
what up sick
i'm better damn it 
 about time



good morning.
yawns. hands you coffee
&lt;3 ::purr:: how you doing this morning?
good. trying to wake up. how are you?
about the same, it's early here. :) i hope your day is a good one though.
awww. hope you day is good as well cutie



so these girls got suspended.. lol next time anybody says the n word on twitter or snap is getting snitched on by me to their principle. 
regardless of race. yes i'm tf petty bc those girls did not deserve to get suspended when all y'all say that word on the damn daily !
i don't say "nigger" on the daily....
aye! thank you for not using a derogatory term to your friends and not cry abt it when white people do in the same manner 
people are saying a word that their ancestors used as they oppressed, enslaved, and raped african americans. it is not the same.
that's exactly it! so why is it okay for black people; the same race that the slur was used towards in every derogatory way,



i'd like my 28 dollars back
coulda hit me up i'm good at that shit
fuck really i want to die idk if it's just fucked bc of the maker or bc o built it wrong :/
tbh i've put together all my ikea shit by myself so... next time hit a girl up
fuck ok i woll i might need to buy something else to build n like im bad at it like i cant even put lego things togeteher
girl i got you



my cat spit up for the very first time yesterday. she's over 2 years old so i was wondering when that shit would start. 
how weird, mine did too. but i'm not sure if it was a hair all or if she just ate too fast
i think she had too many treats. damn kids. lol
the dog kept eating all the cats food, so when i figured it out and fed her, she inhaled her food.  5 minutes later *ack*
ooops
dog cleaned cat's bowl. this went on for a couple days before the cat sat on my head and made her complaint clear



i'm 25 and never been to the pumpkin patch
let's go
i ain't gay
we can double date
i have no one to date josh
yes you do



for the record and i have not and probably will not ever smoke crack
probably
what
you said you will "probably" never smoke crack and i thought it was funny
i don't know the future man. who knows what circumstances i will find myself in.
if you ever find yourself in a situation where you are about to be a crack fiend message me i will help



bestie bestie 
yes bestie bestie? 
i miss you, i miss you, i miss you, i miss you, i miss you, i miss you, i miss you, i miss you, i miss you, i miss you
no dude i miss you! it's not even funny anymore 
when you come down sleep over? have some one on one bestie time?

i've had four bowls of cheerios this morning ama
uncomfortably full? can you feel your cholesterol dropping?
no and no, sadly.
darn! i will record these notes for research
note: i use 2% milk
i will need to find subjects consuming with skim and non-dairy. the soy milk subject () does not report either as well.



what's all ya sext beasts up to tonight?
gettin' old!   what, it's a hobby.
whaaat not writing while getting old?
i've been slacking, true.  world needs more text of muscle balloonification, really.  it's my niche.
yes your work makes the world a better place :u
i've gotten some thoughts from your work in that regard that i really need to type out, one of these days.  thanks!
aw thanks!



wish i could memorize stuff after reading it once smh
that's because your mind doesn't care about what your reading lol.
it kinda does and it kinda doesn't because i actually find this stuff that i'm reading interesting lol
we'll see it's not 100%. yeah best way to memorize stuff is like review notes like an hour three or four times a day.
yeah i need to start going over my notes at least twice a day i just hate studying lol
it sucks man but itll be worth it.
it does but you're right bro it will be worth it at the end!



i finally got mystic messenger &amp; i'm obsessed!! 
yay i am so glad you got it!  i love that game!!!!
what routes have you played?
so far i have started zen, i have completed 707 and jumin.  i have to start zen over because i am so many days behind.
i have 2 days left of zen &amp; 4 for jumin. i rlly want to do 707's bc he hilarious but i heard his route is best saved for last 
i couldn't wait i just played it!  707's route gives a lot away about the story.
haha that's how i felt about jumin - i couldn't wait, i just bought the hg! gonna try to hold out on 707 &amp; hope it's worth it

oh wow! that film still gets me. been in my head because of the election and how close trump is to being a fascist.
it's a classic for sure! a clockwork orange too! those 2 movies' metaphors sum up all of my fears for this country!! 
yea it's roger waters and kubrick territory and it freaks me the fuck out!
exactly!! some crazy foreshadowing shit right there!!
i just hate the nazi rhetoric and #kkk connections this campaign has conjured through trump's camp.

you can name your dumb kid alfred or edward but i can't name mine thelbert, rdwulf, or angeltheow? anglo-saxon double standards suck!
my second is actually edmund which is like halfway there.
edmund is a good name. lot of good edmunds
hillary. i dig burke. the bastard.
big fan of edmund, the earl of rutland who died in like i don't know 1458 or something
wasn't he a big ol jerk who was set to be king but then got himself killed in battle? cause a lotta edmunds are like that.
he was cool but yeah he did get killed in battle. and his brothers were both kings, so maybe he would have gotten around to it



it's intimidation, bullying and str8 up hate speech. but of course it's not cuz well... you know!
bullying? standing up for the rights and health of our community is bullying to you? pathetic
again, not at all what ur doing! the house is burning &amp; ur worried about the outfit!  this ain't about you
the house isn't what's burning, it's your justifications for supporting an anti-gay ticket.
trump isn't anti gay! u keep believing what you want but remember, were still #gaysfortrump!!
while you sit out the fight supporting our lgbt community, you are welcome that the lgbt majority aren't.
do u even see how self centered you are? you think ur the community? gays are so much more than sexuality! sad



boulder council study session now on to pollard site (boulder junction)! just to explore scenarios to develop an rfp.
city owned lot last in phase i, chance to fit in but also fill in some gaps
current boulder junction development units - 91% are two or less bedrooms
(which seems fine unless you have more than two kids? every unit doesn't have to be a forever unit)
coburn says costs to build now $347/sq ft without land costs!! (but large infrastructure costs with parking)
discussing now the parking max 1 space per residential unit; but debating rather parking spots are truly unbundled.
so incompletely unbundled.

do folk even know nor care jane?
i think young people have been raised to feel guilty about their middle-class life instead of being raised to try to achieve more
it's a cop out jane. back in our day we would get the shit kicked out of us. now, parents pacify children.
switch or hand jane....choose!!!!
when i was young, i got the switch.
yes, as did i. and it hurt like a mother fucker!!!! i still have the marks!!! but, it made me the good man i am now.
sometimes jane in our lives we have to take pain &amp; hurt to try to  convey a message.

stevie j &amp; the rest of yall such ethnocentric trash u cant even tell joseline hernandez raps in spanish in an unfakeable rican accent.
as usual its a bunch of ppl who have no clue wtf being rican or dominican is coz they not latinamerican. but swearing they can invalidate
joseline hernandez speaks a whole nother language like a latin-caribbean native: spanish. but u talmbout shes faking bein latina  coz black
ppl are not only fucking oblivious to afrolatinas context, they can literally see us in the thick of it&amp; dunno how to process it. still deny
'her real last names bettencourt so shes not afrolatina'. do u ignit assholes know how many bettencourts there are in latinamerica?
every single bettencourt i ever knew has been puerto rican. every single one

that the brigade got non allies out the whole game, even their side allies only had one loss
fool, this is a different big brother! doesn't matter who wins hoh. #bbott those girls are sticking together. girl power!

i think i'm done with twitter and trying to fit into somewhere i obviously do not belong.
you belong where ever you want to be pup. *noses*

then don't try to fit in. just be yourself, because you're already awsome. ^^
alfa, honestly there isn't a single shred of good in me.
yes there is. you may not see it right this second because of how you feel, but it is there and i see it.
alfa, what little good you used to see in me is gone. finished, used up and never to be seen or heard from again.

romanuk can be such a moron, andersen also had a defence that didn't turn the puck over every shift!!!! #tmltalk
how many shots has he faced today, we've out possessed tampa by a mile, andersen is blatantly bad right now
that's your opinion,it doesn't matter how many shots there are,it's the quality of them,and mistakes by our d are very bad!
it's not an opinion it's a fact, his positioning, movement, etc... he's not playing as he did in anaheim, reimer wouldn't
it's not some surprise that andersen's not playing his best,but he's also not getting much help,that's very clear #tmltalk
each and every time, you think good teams don't give up 5-6 high danger chances a game? the lighting did, bishop answered
ok man,we have different opinions on this,i don't deny he's let in goals he shouldn't,but also not getting much help from d errors

"zero percent" is the best mcr b-side no argument
good post
makes me feel like i'm in a vidya game 10/10 would recommend
it's okay but (drag me) tbp's b sides defined every aspect of my emo ass adolescence
nah i fully get that. kill all my friends + heaven help us are iconic
2 iconque
also the rap in my way home. gerard speed singing is aesthetique



can i just sleep thru one fuckin night?!!
new one for me last night, kept waking up not breathing feeling like someone was suffocating me so that was cool
oh yes that's my exact issue!! only happened twice last night, so it was a "good" night.
nothing like waking up refreshed !! and by refreshed i mean like i haven't slept in 3 days or months
my eyes are burning with sleepiness!!!
maybe the water main will break at work tn
is there a way to like make that happen or...?



after we trade for boogie straight to the finals 
false 
we bout to reclaim our thrown in the east
did you forget about who is still in the east ? 
can't forget him but his time is over
his time not over till he retire 
na it's over after we get one more all star



the art style of dbz combined with the animation of db super would be lit. i just hate the modern art style on db super
i wish they would go back to showing blood/cursing, instead of being a kids show lmao
that would be great but they'll lose out on money and viewership
thats so annoying though. thats how the show was from the beginning.
i know but the show came out in thw late eights early 90's. censorship wasn't as strict as it is now smh
the fuck censoring cartoons and art in general should be fucking illegal fuck
i agree to a certain extent. they should have a channel dedicated to adult themed cartoons. like adultswim but its own channel



hi lady ... how was your first night back at work???
it was good deb, thankfully my work is mental, not physical, plus they hired 2 new girls 4 my shift, so it's easier, less alarms
yay!!!! i'm soooooo happy for you 
feels good 2 be back &amp; not sitting on my ass at home. now i'm sitting on my ass &amp; getting paid for it, lol thanks deb, how r u? 
lol i can imagine it is very nice for you!! i'm great....just enjoying the  &amp; my cubbies in the world series finally 
my husband &amp; myself are both rooting for your cubbies, tom loves how they all sing the cub song after a win!!! 
awww yay!!! we need it!!! i live just a few blocks from the stadium so you can imagine the excitement around here  



fans like me have enough loyalty to this team to endure rf's conservative approach to rebuilding but i don't think the market can sustain it
there comes a point where i genuinely wonder, do the #canes care about fans? wrt the on-ice product, it's not just a team, it's a business.
canes are one decent goalie away from being among the nhl's best young teams.
then we need to find that goalie. the fans were not happy abt ward's resigning &amp; they won't be happy if we blow the home opener
exciting doesn't cut it if all we do is lose lose lose.
this market needs playoff hockey badly. perfect time for it, too: state sucks, panthers suck. we need something to believe in.
canes are a playoff quality team at fwd &amp; dmen; both goalies would clear waivers



ok 
hi pal
oh hi buddy
how are you doing?
sleepy and missing houston are two constant feelings. how are you?
i feel you on the first one and ready to meet the little one soon.
yes!! you, your sweet lil lady, and ryan need to come visit! we have plenty of room for all of y'all to stay!

kawhi is the best player on the court at this current moment
mvp year

my friends just reminded me that there's a horrific picture of me blacked out at an after prom from high school somewhere on the internet

hello how is everyone doing today?
don't act like you have friends on twitter you're talking to...
if i don't have friends then why do so many people follow me huh
spam bots. also no big deal or anything, but i have a few more followers than you...
i've lived in one place my whole life so that's my excuse
are you saying that living in south dakota helped get me more followers???
ofc you had people you knew there



the cops hate andrea man
what happen
not just one cop, but two got her azz
omg whyyy lhh
snapping and driving, swerving all over the place, speeding  must i go on
lhh oh my gosh! and she didn't get one ticket?
you can talk to the felon



sooo because you got me hooked on #thisisus - i need you to hurry up and watch tonight's episode so we can talk about it!
i'm staying up late to watch this just for you!
ahhhh did you cry?!
why is he on the fireplace?! noooooo!!!
i'm so sad! he was such a cool dad! did they divorce and then he died? was alcoholism to blame? so many questions!
did they divorce?! i know mandy is with the bff. could be drama, could be ok.
i have so many questions.



lowkey wanna cry i just re pierced my nipple 
yourself or you went to get them re done ????
no by myself just now 
i know that hurt !!!!!omg!!!
hell yessss
omg i couldn't
hell ya next time i'm just gonna let it close lol



my goal: to watch an episode of #thisisus without weeping uncontrollably. my hunch: it will not happen.
well i made it 51 minutes without crying. a new record. i was so close to getting to the end. damn you #thisisus !
does it count itself out if you were crying before,(a stubbed toe) stopped, then cried again? 26 minutes. #thisisus
was the second waterworks from the show or still the stubbed toe?
toe~then stopped~then started again during the show.
hmm. that may just be fortuitous timing?
i'm gonna take it as a loss then try again. 26 min isn't absurdly bad. plus i'm a chic.



sarina paris - look at us #tb
pissed u never came.
nap said yall weren't coming earlier then when yall hit me up and said yall are it was 11 already lmao
so wha? ur still awake 
yeah but i was already in bed

how bad was it, u got pics? lmao
it was bad but it's looking better now lol i'll take you a pic tomorrow cuz i don't have any haha
lol sounds good






it's so easy to box away the opposition when you only have two boxes to choose from.
third parties are a waste of time and have always proven as such. its always been a two-party system. facts of life.
i don't play by the rules. i'm funny that way.
you've also never elected anyone outside of either the gop or dnc. guess you're funny that way as well.
guess you don't validate me or complete me.
guess you're just another squishy, uninformed garden-variety political neophyte.



4:12 am
night owl lol
 work nigga 
easy money get that fool. liam keeping me up watching tv smh 
i need to see him soon, next weekend !
come get him bro 
next weekend lol.



i forgot my headphones for the gym this morning and it was surprisingly pleasant
i listened to r.e.m. in the car in your honor
they are on my work out playlist. twice actually
the automatic for the people album is my absolute favorite. the whole thing. i had the tape &amp; it was yellow.
it's probably not the "popular opinion" but i always go back to new adventures in hi-fi.
e-bow the letter has to be in my top 5 of all of their songs, for sure.
mine too. and leave. i love the guitar work on that song.



fairly-to-very embarrassed how many times i have listened to grigio girls.
i'm just not feeling this record. a little disappointing after 3 years off. million reasons isn't bad, the one song i like.
i think it's better than artpop, which is a low bar. beyond that, yeah, could be better for sure. just this one weird earworm.
i think joanne is missing a big dance hit. but maybe she's truly done with the days of the sounds of the fame/fame monster.
i hope not. cynically, doubt joanne will spawn any hits, which hopefully will leave her scurrying back to the dancefloor for #6
i've changed my mind, some good tracks have grown on me.
which?



the audacity 
sound like a girl
sound like u omd
md you gay
md fagget
gay ass nigga
md brokey



sometimes i think my mum's a bot, then not, then i think she's a bot then not
maybe she's just delusional?
i want to wait and see on this i've felt so similar but i have no proof
whenever i try to explain something controversial to her she never gets it and she's a smart woman -
i mean what kind of human can be this ignorant?
does it seem intentional? like she intentionally keeps herself ignorant so she doesn't have to actually think about things
maybe your perspective hasn't been tainted with miseducation and complacence. that gets in the way in a lot of cases



your tweet seemed somewhat humane, but the last part was an attack on your behalf. don't @ me stupid shit like that
don't victimize yourself raul. just don't. just chill.
how about you message or call me, and thoroughly explain any frustration you may have. other than that, nothing will be solved
how about you don't tweet towards people, bashing them, publicly and there wouldn't be anything to be solved in the first place.
is that it? that's it? or is there anything else in your agenda worth mentioning? hm.
i don't know, is there?
no. i havnt had any complaints, can't fix anything if i don't know there's problem. all except for my twitter rampage, right?



pray for me...i have hell in me and i am fighting it with a vengeance.  i am trying to take the high road but...
hope you are ok hun! dnt let them win you stay being you're true self and continue taking the high road like you always do 
but i wanna @ that rat and tell him to choke on hiv infested cum sandwich!!!!
i feel u! i haven't @ the irrelevant bb houseguests yet but i sure was close! i'm trying to be somewhat positive but it is hard!!
#zaulie living their life. if they don't like them, fine! but why hate? it's burning me up on the inside. trying to calm down.
it's not even worth your energy! they are a nobody! whatever you decide to do though i got yo back!! 100% no questions asked! 
thanks boo



there's a hold on my account so i can't enroll for classes... and i only have 2 days to do it smh
emergency contact?
yes!!! but i'm not the only one.. a few of my other friends from cal poly said they updated a week ago and its still there
no it's like everyone:/
that's so annoying..  do you have priority?
yeah i do. you?
i do! so it's only 2 days... hopefully everything works out 



happy birthday!
damn jay, the plug like that bro
you want me to give you a lil shout out?
lmao put your boy on
you went sky diving?
nah, just a cool ass picture
 i was gonna say ur lucky lmao, i wanna go so bad



i'm so sleepy.
schleep
i would lol if it were that simple.
lmao cant just close ya eyes and count sheep?
i'm at the er. might put my head in my lap lol but that's the best i got.
whoa, everything ok?
yah i think so.



today on twitter, i'd like to talk the butt as it relates to parasite lifecycles.any and all pictures will be sfw.
) did the movie dreamcatcher, which prominently features butt aliens.
these aliens enter through the mouth, consume their host, and exit through the butt in a gory fashion when done.
, who was on oxycontin at the time. opioid painkillers can make you constipated; may have inspired aliens
as gross, weird, &amp; horrifying as this lifecycle is, a lot of critters either make the butt their home or use it to complete their lifecycle
today, i am celebrating the critters who call butts their home.also, if you're pooping out living things, please see a doctor.
your psa tweets make me love twitter so. ;-)



i wanna go to del osso 
let's go 
yayyy
but when 
i'm free whenever 
we can go sunday when i get off?
yes please 



i feel awful 
you want me to make you some soup?

i've got you, do you want chicken noodle or potato?
chicken noodle :)
i'll see if i can make you some 
omg i love you, thanks girl



went to the gym now we just ordered pizza, its fine though bc it counteracts it
traitor
theres no yops here! but if you wanna send me some, that'd be cool too
like a ubake? in a freezer thingy??
yeah! you'd have to like 2 day ship though

you're so real

hey abi
lol hey

also exaid?
yup!
less then two hours of work and 1% battery on phone
oh dear
*nose boop*



i'm not ready for this episode fam
missed it sunday, and someone canceled my recording :)  i'm never up this late, but i'm staying up to watch replay at 3:30!
it's rough
started at 315.  20 minutes in and i'm already at a loss for words....
that...was disturbing.
i'm still in shock...it was unnecessarily brutal
thought glenn was toast a 100 times already, but abraham? thought there was more for his character bcuz of the biblical name



ppl will argue bc its in the comic blah blah thats why he died
and one of the few times the comic is followed, it's to kill the only asian character. like really?? bye.
lol but of course. unless he got something big in the works. there is no excuse
yeah exactly. i haven't heard any justification for his death that i even semi-agree with.
the light rumor is he is joining the dceu as nightwing
i would love for him to join the mcu or the dceu, but nightwing is romani and erasing a romani role wouldn't be okay
they are just going to cast someone white anyway. you already know. why not give it to him?



wow, this furore over the esc keys removal might last almost as long as the one about the headphone jackanyone remember that?
yup. it's why i decided i didn't want to upgrade until there are adaptors.
adaptors for what? the esc key?
oh. i was talking about the headphone jack.
thats what confused me. the adaptor comes in the box, no?
sorry. i spend a lot of time listening to music with my phone plugged into a powerbank. i know i'm an outlier.
aaah, ok. yeah, i didnt think there were many who did that a lot, but it sounds like its more common than i thought



if u don't know me or hang with me i feel bad for you bc i'm a great person and i'm funny af.
bitch where
bitch i miss u haven't seen you since that party lmao
aye round two this friday ;)
hit me up u know i'm down for whatever ayyy (;
text me then i'll hit you up
black out haha



so many words to absorb on the bio. i feel like sponge bob. scientist, i'll drop the mic there. unless it's scientology.
nix nein non on the "scientology."i'm a biologist, but work in petroleum.
which is bio. was hoping quantum mechanics. bio can get boring. how is that different than geological exploration?
my quantum mechanics experience is limited to the monte carlo simulation.
that's math
it's math, but more like determining where you're at in space and time; helps me help people improve decision-making.
most ppl would not see that as being helpful.



i cannot stop listening to #tiimyturner
i like it but it's hard to sing along to bc of the n word every 3 seconds
i just say it. i ain't ashamed!
omg  guess what guess wjat
???????
im coming to alabama for thanksgiving
we can't make it for christmas. if we can get off, we are going to try to come up for a day at thanksgiving. at least i am



twitter is so depressing tonight cause the cubs are losing 
go cards
go cards it is
you're welcome
i'm so happy you're a cards fan
i'm so happy you're not a cubbies fan
i have so much respect for you now



dame or kawhi for mvp maybe lebron bc he is lebron but dame &amp; kawhi are my top choices
don't leave out my boy russ like that man 
shii my bad lol you right bro! definitely those 3 but i don't think they'll win enough for him to win it ya know?
idkkk i think they win i dont know i think they'll win more than blazers
idk actually about dame either bc i don't think the blazers or thunder will be seeded higher than 6
it's stupid bc dame &amp; russ will both put up #s but if their team isn't ballin they ain't winning it's dumb
to get that mvp respect on a decent record team



so these girls got suspended.. lol next time anybody says the n word on twitter or snap is getting snitched on by me to their principle. 
regardless of race. yes i'm tf petty bc those girls did not deserve to get suspended when all y'all say that word on the damn daily !
i don't say "nigger" on the daily....
aye! thank you for not using a derogatory term to your friends and not cry abt it when white people do in the same manner 
people are saying a word that their ancestors used as they oppressed, enslaved, and raped african americans. it is not the same.
that's exactly it! so why is it okay for black people; the same race that the slur was used towards in every derogatory way,
to repeat that word to whoever they want to and get a freebie for it? shouldn't they be the 1st ones to not use it at all?



i wish we didn't own a house so we can pack and leave to colorado. i love it out there 
girl, it's way to expensive out here
i'm sure we can manage, but a lot holds me back. idk if i could live without my mom 
i thought i couldn't , but here i am 
lmao i know but my kids  it's something we want to do. but there's so much we have to do before we make any decisions.
true , it's hard being away from family, but when you are away you find yourself being more happy then you ever thought you'd be
our mortgage is pretty high, but i meant like carlos has a good stable job.



how do you start your day off? meditation? yoga? running? let us know so we can share! #upgradeyourself
i start my day with prayer and a walk. #selfcare #wellbeing #natural #holistic
that sounds lovely! fresh air and fresh thoughts to start the day :)
how do you start your day?
with water and supplements ;)
i do those too. just after my walk. i need to get into the habit of having water first thing when i wake. it does a body good
it's such a simple yet effective thing to practice. keep a bottle beside your bed so you can't forget in the morning ;)



anger issues? he humiliated you, megyn. you're a joke, mk.
i don't watch that crazy hag!! what happened!! #teamnewt
she pressed gingrich on trump's remarks about women..
no one has brought that crap up today until her!
all she can talk about. her ratings are down, which is good.
will welcome her.
since cnn has no ratings, it may be a good fit.



i got fake people showing fake love to me
shut up
wassup andyyyyy
wass good?!
i miss your hoe ass! when are you coming back ?
this weekend cuz
text me this weekend  and we can all hangout



how many award-winning dishes or tasting menus have cooked green pepper? probably zero.
like...bell pepper? or any?
green and cooked. tastes like the 80s.
saison did a gourmet version of a jalapeo popper once. that was green and cooked.
i mean cooked green bell pepper not jalapeno. overpowers &amp; kills meat dishes/sauce. other peppers/colors/fresh/sparingly ok
yeah, that's why i asked. it's often a filler vegetable. maybe in new mexico?
what amanda said. those stuffed green peppers (from the 70s/80s.)



so, what did you think about that episode -twd?
part that was horrific was panning the faces &amp; the fear that showed &amp; 15 or so minutes b4 knew-so intense
for me it was glenn trying to talk to maggie.
it was sad. abraham so brave. now what happens to the "family"?
negan evil but rick's group acted as mercenaries,killed negan's men while they slept-love interplay of good/bad imperfect ppl
yes.
rick is crushed now. to take back his leadership role means sacrificing daryl! and i do love that redneck



my mom really made up some bullshit as to why i wasn't going to glamis. that shit just pissed me off so much holy fuck.
your not going???
no. her bitch ass told me she cancelled the trip and then now all of a sudden is going with all of her friends.
awh i wish you were!!!!! we'd have so much fun.
yeah. literally everyone is going and i got fucked over out of my family trip. i'm fucking pissed.
awh i'm sorry :( convince her!!!!
i can't get the days off now. it's way too late.



n i cant even see him 



awwww justin you're only a half hour ish away. you should meet up with her.
never gonna happen m8 it wud have by nah i only live on huddersfield
boooooooooo!! it needs to happen.
it isn't hes in glasgow tomorrow no way near me depressing knowin hes 40 mins in a car away from me lol
trust me i know that feeling.



all have a theology, what we think to be true of god, &amp; a creed (written or unwritten), what we say to be true of god. what informs it?
a rainbow speaks to god's nature apart from the bible. but it's through the bible that christians believe that. fascinating.
so my curiosity runs wild to find out what a rainbow means, what does it reveal about god thru scripture?...
according to biblical text, god gave it while promising that never again shall he destroy the world by flood.
and i've heard that him setting his "bow" in the clouds is like a warrior putting down a weapon.
i don't know if that's true, it's plausible...but things like that keep me digging &amp; enjoying the journey!
good enough for me.



ok...exactly what are y'all mad at ciara about???
i'm mad at her because she never gave me my hoodie back after the breakup
you'll be fine
im so cold tho
get you a chubby girl to lay up with
naw...they pussy too good...make me do crazy tings man
like what

how is it that airpods are going to be the cheap option to get a w1 chip in headphones?
and even with that price a lot of people have been complaining (mostly those that would never buy anyhow)
but, switching between devices is something that i want to be able to do without huge issue. so airpods might be the best option.
they are definitely the easiest option.im currently using the dash headphones - only paired to my iphone though
i probably dont know what i am missing out on. thatll probably change here in the coming weeks as i get used to airpods
yeah, i think a lot of it is getting used to headphones being wireless and living with the changed parameters of that
i am ready for wireless. my wired headphone device switching system at work is ridiculous!



my dad still gives me shit to this day about choosing dance over sports smh

if it goes to 6/7, we will take u



basically larping the cats musical right now while i take my cat 4 his last walk in this neighborhood. neighborhood strays monitoring us....
gonna be interesting walking him by the new place. apparently there are a lot of chihuahuas there and he, a big kitty, thinks they're prey.
it might help if our walks are in the middle of the night but i'm gonna want to get a feel for the area first. and uh. maybe a can of mace.
... don't get mugged
probably going to invest in one of those pointy self defense things that go on your keychain
i would definitely be a victim of friendly fire if i got mace.
.. yeah don't mace yourself. the pointy thing is a good idea.



warriors big are soft. warriors gotta fill the center position
that's why trade klay thompson for demarcus cousins
nope
why not.!?
just cause
you crazy i would do that trade anyday...
i want a defensive center. we got enough scoring players



imy
i will be back in cc soon lil homie
like when exactly ?? 
i think thanksgiving is the earliest
alright bro 
i'll hit you or you sis up when i'm headed down
alright bro



of course trump supporters are mad at megyn kelly she's a woman with a brain and an opinion. she bounces outside the gop bubble of delusion.
she's in her own bubble. calling someone a sexual predator as if it was solid fact is not an opinion. trash trump, rightly
everybody said the same thing when it happened to bill cosby and look how that turned out.
people also said that about 3000 other men during our country's existence and they turned out innocent, even 20 years later
i would be more concerned about donald trump's upcoming child rape case...that one disturbs me on many levels.
can it be disturbing if no proof has been brought forth yet? because until then it's just a story.
it's going to trial in december so enough proof has been brought forward to get that far.

not only is my favourite writer from portland but the twitterverse keeps connecting me w/ writers from or. thanks 4 the follow
it's a great area! very conducive for creativity. how's toronto?
indefinitely!toronto is home: hopeful in sports &amp; bustling w multiculturalism. beautiful but full of traffic &amp; condos. &amp; cold!
sounds like portland! just trade cold for rainy ;)
a friend just came back from portland &amp; was surprised how small it was compared to toronto. i want to visit it looks beautiful.
definitely, it's got some hot spots, but overall, it's way less crowded than the average city.
is a local celeb. he's my favourite #writer 






at apex '15. he got that easy money as i remember
remember when that smash 2 guy tried to pull that one on us at big house?
not really. but i bet it happened. did i bop him?
no you went "yea.. suuurrre it's ur first tournament" then you told me you could tell he ain't a melee guy
cuz he didn't react to "smash 2"
damn i'm good



, you think hillary is wonderful. she isn't. but how could you know that? you don't live our lives or know her crimes.
"conservatarian" must mean that you only consume information that comes through chain emails or talk radio.
conservative libertarian. and you must be a hillary fan.
yep. because i don't get my info from chain emails or talk radio.
i'll further bet you haven't even glanced at the wikileaks emails, &amp; you think russia made them up. that's how gullible you are.
i don't think they were made up (without further proof) but i (and our intelligence services) understand that russia leaked them.
but the fact is, the emails contained nothing very damning. they were mild at best.



finna go hoop.
about to get crossed up 
bad game

quick, name me something more demoralizing than applying to jobs for which you are overqualified
applying to jobs for which you are perfectly qualified and not even getting a call
ugh ok yes i've been there too recently and blahhhhh
it sucks so hard
i am at my wit's end here
(hugs)i feel like that more often than i'd like to admit.
i sorta feel like i've made a huge mistake

ok...now i can use this coupon on xv or dr4....hmmm
nigga, are you serious? dead rising 4, nah, just dead series.
series not bad lok
it is after 3.
i only played a demo for 3. only thing i noticed is no strict time and the game is dark aesthetic wise for whatever reason
and restrictive and rife with performance issues.
dr4 looks fun but wtf happened to frank



the only reason they don't? they will not deviate from #theplan which includes trusting #hunter and his drafting. allow picks to develop.
if that isn't their plan, which i guarantee it is, then they are morons.  never have more cap room than the next 2 yrs..
wrong. mentality is to win every game right now. management controls the time frame. that mentality though is fragile.
when you have 3 all stars on ecls you have no better time to load up
i agree. insulate. but the retained salary sucks and why blow the cap on risky ufas that restrict paying the young studs
lucky the nhl ways has excellent mid level stepniak / parenteus available for free every summer
hah! versteeg? i get it. plug the holes with cheap vets. smart.



it fucking hurts to even lay my head down. god.
did you try taking some ibuprofen?
away. 
i'm sorry, babe. wish i could do something to help.
it's okay, babe. just sucks when i have to go to school and do things instead of resting.
yeah, i know. 
i don't know if i'm going to take tomorrow off or not. just have to see how i feel in the morning.



#hereiamwithher wondering how screwed up you have to be to vote for her just because she has a vagina.
it's more like because hillary has a brain in her head, unlike her opponent who needs to be, off to see the wizard..
according to wikileaks she's not to bright and that's coming from the ppl who work for her.
have you actually even gone to wikileaks or do you just read the edited and highlighted stuff they pass around twitter?
i've read them yes and that's lame to try to say it's edited. yesterday i read one where they needed to sober her up, lol
if you've actually read them directly, can you forward me a link?
simple google wikileaks



gonna be live at the kanye concert

tbh would have preferred escape over ye, but wasn't gonna happen :(
damn , should have just shown up to escape in a wheel chair i would have helped raised you up during the sets
haha that wasn't the problem, i needed a ride and my sister wasn't going.
haha oh damn that sucks , should have rode with us lol
yea but i only knew of 1 person going and it's just weird to try and go solo lol
oh aww no rave fam. yeah and i tend to move around a lot stage to stage so i wouldn't expect you to tag along with us there lol



do people still play world of warcraft? like that sounds like such an iconic mid 2000s thing but it still exists???
remind me to tell you about my wow obsessed, mega loser of a cousin sometime 
how much good boy points does he have?
his rice score is hands down 100
jesus fucking christ how is that even possible? my friend who is waiting till marriage for sex is at least a 72
and here i am with my what, 17?
p much. i'm at like a 30



if you're so confident in your "non-binary" gender, why do you so easily get offended by everything?
i used to be on tumblr a lot and totally caught up in the insane dogma, i think a lot of the oversensitivity is bc ppl are
completely agree with you. i used to be a hardcore sjw as well and almost came out to my mom as agender. glad i'm outta there
awesome, it always makes me hopeful to see more ppl who have turned their critical thinking back on
it was so funny because i left religion before, thinking i was breaking free from people who didn't think rationally
but i dragged myself into another similar cult. i'm like simultaneously patting myself on the back and chiding myself rn
i wasnt raised religious but i feel you on that lol.. i cant believe the shit i bought into, but at least i stopped..



happy c-day my nigga 
my nigga big birdd shit fam thanks my dude that shit means a lot stay up out there g

took slim shady ep &amp; offspring americana tapes to elementary school &amp; got suspended 4 a wk. #wellworthit #1999
got cronic 2001 as valentines gift from my gf in 7th grade, and my mom found it broke it into pieces
on my floor when i came home from school and she immediately thought i was smoking weed. (didn't till i was 20)
i wasn't allowed anything with that parental advisory sticker
ouch, back in the day especially the 90s the best records had the sticker. you must have been in radio disney hell



so is wikileaks credible? can anyone say for sure? it seems like no one knows and what u believe is based on ur party
i don't think there is any evidence that they have doctored materials.
so wikileaks is sort of like snowden? if what they are saying is credible, honest liberal media should cover that too... yeah?
ny times with a huge cover story on new wikileaks today. not sure why you think the liberal media isn't covering?
ok today exactly they did, before this or no?
i think it's been pretty widely covered on a daily basis..every day, i see stories highlighting new info
then how does hillary still have any credibility?

how does ohio state drop behind louisville? the acc is the joke of college football.
because louisville would have destroyed penn state!!
i wouldn't be so sure about that. louisville wouldn't stand a chance against osu, mich, neb, wisconsin.....
dude osu just lost to penn state we will beat nebraska um will be a good game
you obviously don't know how hard it is to win at psu.... you think b1g teams are overrated? louisville is in the acc 
how its looking the acc and the big ten have 2 truly good teams neb will have 2ls and wisconsin already have 2 be honest!!
clemson is overrated. they struggled badly with troy (lmao). wis only 2 loses (osu, um). nebraska still have 3 tough games



i'm not ready for this episode fam
missed it sunday, and someone canceled my recording :)  i'm never up this late, but i'm staying up to watch replay at 3:30!
it's rough
started at 315.  20 minutes in and i'm already at a loss for words....
that...was disturbing.
i'm still in shock...it was unnecessarily brutal
but agreed.  that was rough to watch.

the bacterial eye infection in the wolf was secondary to likely demodex mites. #drkexoticvet
could you take care of the demodex mites with bravecto? or would that only work in domestic dogs?
no studies on bravecto in other species so we don't know safety and efficacy.
thanks, dr. thielen! are you currently filming for the next season of dr. k's? :d i can't wait!!! love the cases &amp; team.
we just finished filming not too long ago! new episodes feb!
do you ever struggle with compassion fatigue? i know that it is a major problem in the profession currently.
interesting to bring up. i don't suffer from cf but burn out from working all these hours. my residency almost killed me!



so many words to absorb on the bio. i feel like sponge bob. scientist, i'll drop the mic there. unless it's scientology.
nix nein non on the "scientology."i'm a biologist, but work in petroleum.
which is bio. was hoping quantum mechanics. bio can get boring. how is that different than geological exploration?
my quantum mechanics experience is limited to the monte carlo simulation.
that's math
it's math, but more like determining where you're at in space and time; helps me help people improve decision-making.
how being nowhere and in several places at the exact same time as a wave and particle but not unless obsearved would help



i cannot wait to move next month into a civilized area with reliable internet.
who's gonna be your provider?
either comcast or centurylink, i think. but literally anything would be an improvement.
might want to check out comcast new....data cap policy coming in november before you go to them.
will do
i guess living alone and i used 560gb which makes zero sense....
wtf how



the walking dead just messed me up so much. and they killed my favorite character. i'm shook. 
i am still not okay.
same. i feel like i was there.
very nervous to see what a season with negan is like.
i read the comics so it's gonna get interesting and jeffrey dean morgan plays him amazing.
jeffrey dean morgan is amazing in everything he does. i will probably come to love him.
its so hard though.

my goal: to watch an episode of #thisisus without weeping uncontrollably. my hunch: it will not happen.
well i made it 51 minutes without crying. a new record. i was so close to getting to the end. damn you #thisisus !
does it count itself out if you were crying before,(a stubbed toe) stopped, then cried again? 26 minutes. #thisisus
was the second waterworks from the show or still the stubbed toe?
toe~then stopped~then started again during the show.
hmm. that may just be fortuitous timing?
i am gonna take the loss &amp; try again next ep. (it's wicked) jk it's late here. congrats on your time. til next week.#thisisus

so tell them to stop carrying one crappy made in china knock off line (ivanka) so we can all happily shop there
i'm sorry, but i think this is totally weird since so much has been made by other companies in asia for years.
oh sure, not about china really that's a side point. it's about discouraging others from running as a nazi demagogue
woah... did i miss something? is she using human body parts in her fibers?
because another round of this will lead to unabomber style militia violence.if capitalist person choice can stop,yay
so, i take it you aren't voting? both candidates are capitalists.

watching this tnt nba deal about race, such weak sauce, so out of touch of the legit issues of the movement, why bother then
like...what...is...the...point if you're giving one sided opinions?
can at least one of them talk about their experience about how they were fd with because of their race, they have stories
especially jim brown. they're not offering anything outside of typical victim/community blaming. this is solving nothing.
barkley is so out of touch, he is an uncle tom
chuck is so far gone from race relations. on a scale of 1 to oj simpson, he's up there on being out of touch on his community
totally, but i liked the ok doc, haha



and i dnt ever shoot my shot smh

i've never been so tilted than watching a chat argue over which is better blood viles or estus.
game theory here i come
didn't help that the person streaming was the one that caused the argument. 
you could be necking vodka for all i care, and i would still buy the damn thing on day one
yes and no on the same thing lol. his main complaint was farming blood viles.
either way by the end of the game you come out with way too many of them, and barely anything can touch you
well he was treating it like dark souls tho. running passed mobs to go to the boss. so yeah he was bound to run out.



#wikileaks has confirmed everything non-hc shields have been saying about hillaryat least hillary being corrupted isn't up 4 debate anymore
if wikileaks is all u have...that's pathetic. every time they release emails, she widens her lead over trump and jill
no it isn't but they have proven hillary is a two faced person.
btw what happened 2 ur jill logo. have u dumped her already? she needs you cuz you is all she has now.
i still have tnonope. she has others
with citations
yeah i saw them site things that proved the narrative they wanted



#msnbc #morningjoe 2010 teaparty came to blow governance up and they did #trump #bannon coming to blow country up #vote #hrc=critical

do you know how much experience i would need to get an email back? or how long it would take to hear back

it took me 6 weeks to get my job from application, and i was already on the books haha
alright i appreciate it!



interesting. catching up on internal sops in the office this morning.  we've a new health and safety policy for working alone in the field.
is it to not point the lasers at yourself?
yes! do not point the lasers at yourself or anyone else.  ;p

that is fricking badass, no lie

i watched "hate rising" last night. highly recommended. the corridor scene with ramos and the trump camaign says it all. #nevertrump
i dvred it. haven't finished watching it yet. was at the point where he was interviewing the second guy.
the weirdo nazi groups are as expected - it's the people who might pass for normal who are shocking.
exactly! the "shirt and tie, white nationalist" as the one lady put it. they have a better chance of recruiting more people.
it's astonishing anyone is that stupid and obtuse on purpose in this century.
eh, a lot of these folks aren't stupid though. it's about fear. they're afraid of "change".
it's just another flavor of victimhood.
exactly. one thing i will say though, through the first three interviews he seemed too standoffish with the interviewees.



yo i've never vibed with someone like this before
go to sleep
imy &amp; my peanut :(( 
miss u too !! i got her hospital bag ready today

i send pictures of pigs to hayden to talk about how shitty they look
wow you're such a great influence on the new ffa members, you should be so proud of yourself

i'm allowed to talk about pig with my boyfriend that is my business
talking "shit" about other people's animals isn't your business.
it's my opinion of an animal therefore it is my business
okay well no more opinions on mine. not your business. so keep your mouth shut. i'm done with this

okay but at least you got merch. be happy!!! you've experienced his show!! the little things matter most.
i'm not complaining.



as bad as that segment was, still better than a women's arm wrestling match on raw.
stole the words out of my mouth #rawisaturdsandwich
hah. watched the review huh?
thanks for the review by the way. funny i think a lot of the same shit you do when shits going down on #wweprogramming
that's why we're here. amazing how many people think the same way.
when u got hllywd writers with no wrestling brain writing a wrestling show you get "we want wrestling chants"   #embarrassedfan
yeah, sd is the superior show right now.
smackdown looks like the attitude era compared to raw right now. as hard to watch as #impactwrestling. #needcoffeeforthis



i lost 8lbs in 7 days eating only salads, turkey meat, grilled chicken breasts, grapes, and 2 gallons of water a day.
oh it's lit. congrats boo. i really need to do something.
i gotta lose about 30 more before i go home for tg. i had to tame my sugar crave. i got it under control now
how sway? i need to lose 30 period.
i had to stomach the fact that salads help tremendously. darker the green, the better. i cut up chicken and turkey with it.
i like spinach salads so that's fine. it's just exercise i'm annoyed by
yeah, i hate exercising. period!!! so what i do is just a few sit ups and push ups and go to la fitness and play bball.
i'm gonna start walking /jogging again. that's really all that doesn't annoy me.

ik lets have a reunion



sim city exactly. they want to force demand and development around choo choos. it wont work because we arent lab rats. #tcnt
look around the blue, green and northstar lines. it is already happening.
there is a long, long way to go. plus the bond market risks. then the other question is, is it even ethical?
why isn't this the same for road construction? it's all social/civil engineering. shouldn't pretend otherwise.
with roads its very easy to determine if you are supplying what is wanted, not forcing it.
that's silly. congestion isn't a sign that more lanes are needed. examples are everywhere. atlanta is a good one.
the vast majority of those things have all kinds of capital and fiscal problems. choo choos were only sensible when the ...
...country was poorer.



me?
mmhmm
i haven't nutted since last wednesday /thursday. i'm on lock down by bryant as far as that goes lmao. he said i gotta hold it
i know!!i wanna edge, but i know if i do imma hit the wrong pressure point and explode!

is there a reason people tend to choose romantic partners that they look like they could be related to? like, a scientific reason
it's weird, buddies.
they want to have offspring that look like them because they want to pass off their genes both phenotypically and genotypically
makes sense to just breed with relatives then, que no
i mean they also don't want a child with extra toes we're programmed to not want to mate with persons we have known since birth
makes sense. what about gay couples tho
please weigh in. all my bio knowledge has been used up
lmao i think the answer is people wanna do themselves



i'm. going. to. kill. her.

the politics behind this eric garner killing are unprecedented. doj to bring charges after edny declined. loretta will be gone soon too.
doj bringing it to show prosecutors are not tools and no one is above the law
the pba union lawyers are not skilled though will be interesting to see who gets hired
it's unprecedented that the local feds don't go forward and the doj steps in
don't know much about the edny prosecutor personally other than he comes from a family of decorated det's so i can understand his decision
makes me  how much black people have contributed to the laws and policies and fiber of the anglo american legal system think about it?
in regards to the politicians in power that saw their communities devastated &amp; wanted something "done" for their support.
nah just how much we have been pawns in the legal system and to the case law



westbrook, irving, curry, lillard, paul. that's my top 5 pgs an idc about yours
harden #1
harden barely in my top 10. he's still a sg to me

while that may be true harden is easily top 10
you're dumb. if you wanna consider him a pg he just entered a class that he's not the top of. top sg, not top pg
most of the top 10 point guards are 2 way players. harden ain't no 2 way player

soooo lssu has a former major junior player on their team that's leading their team in scoring... thats not legal#thingsthatmakeyouwonder
but if theres shenanigans there, ill take forfeits on the debacles this weekend.
he also went back to tier 3 juniors for some time too. coaches recruited him knowing he was semi-pro. violation?
i suggest that you refer this to your coaching staff.  tell lance that geof morris sent you.
is allowing it, even if the ncaa missed it somehow.
theyll read email.  :)
you must not know lance very well :)
okay, youve got me there.  i wonder if his # is still the same.

you are what you eat!!!"this means that you are various vitamins and minerals"
does that mean i'm chorizo and sour cream right now?
err i mean booty
actually it means that you are just various chemicals that make up the chorizo, because chorizo is a sausage which is from an
animal that also has to eat something which means they also are what they eat, which also means so on and so forth
why you gotta get so real with me, now i wont be able to sleep after all these beers
what do beers eat to make them beers.
the sunshine and whatever water eats



do the indian groundsmen even bother to prepare a wicket, or do they just chuck some dirt down and stomp it in? #indvsnz
what happend in the last 3 odi s dont u know what happend in the 2 odi #ind lost by 6 runs in 2 ings its a sportive track
the tracks not sporting. there's a reason why india only win at home then get the shit pasted out of them all round the globe
then why do #nz gets high in opening part.. they loose wick in mid ovs its the turn over its not about the pitches. who plays
it's the dead pitches with no bounce that spin like a top. you never see india replicate this outside the subcontinent
what about the #aus #nz world cup did any one questioned even #indvsnz have spinners dont blame the pitch. improve ur game
nz made the final and india didn't you muppet.
in the 3rd odi #nz dropped #kholi s catch  its a match turning point !! #indvsnz pitches wont decide matches. it all in the team



really wanna start shameless but would also like to keep my sanity
doooo itttt...dooooo ittttt
i already know so much of what happens though id only watch it for ian and mickey lmao
same..i watched it only for them, however they dont really appear that much at first. but i fell in love w the plot&amp;other ppl
ahhhh i'll think about it 
i should probably continue it but i needed a small break from it lol especially since college fucks me up haha
ohhhh yeah schools fucking my ass at the moment so i feel ya, there's no hope for me catching up on tv shows yet 
i know if i start watching it again i'll get hooked and i can't rn haha hopefully over winter break!

one day. wear what you like but be ready to drink my friend.
have no fear, i'm always ready to drink! lol



my cat spit up for the very first time yesterday. she's over 2 years old so i was wondering when that shit would start. 
how weird, mine did too. but i'm not sure if it was a hair all or if she just ate too fast
i think she had too many treats. damn kids. lol
the dog kept eating all the cats food, so when i figured it out and fed her, she inhaled her food.  5 minutes later *ack*
ooops
dog cleaned cat's bowl. this went on for a couple days before the cat sat on my head and made her complaint clear
surprised they cat didn't beat up the dog.
oh, she does that regardless. lol






dude i'm in love with him  i neeeeeed his number lol

i'm still waiting on all this free healthcare, college, housing, and money from the government, that everyone says us native americans get.
yeah, i could use a bit of that too
yeah, i really didn't care for paying the penalty for not having health insurance when i was laid off last year
the healthcare situation is actually better than when we were kids. but still not the best. er visits over hastings visits
man, i can't count how many times we had to drop someone off at hastings, usually in the middle of the night.
long drive to get told your std isn't a pregnancy
can't forget about the time i had to take marcus butler to the muskogee er when he got pepper sprayed in the dorm parking lot
i remember that, poor guy, he's a lover not a fighter

when you coming down
but if you're in clarksdale, i can put you on with someone i deliver to
i'll be there thursday 



are you ok?
yeah i was in the other room. why?
with all the harassment and bullying.
one of my other tweeps knows his identity. he's got an autograph signing business.
good! so if he follows through on his threats we know who he is. they seldom follow through but be careful.
he's in the celeb industry. they get wind of him targeting people and his reputation is shot.
i've taken screenshots of the abusive tweets.
thanks love :)



i actually miss reading books rn. 
i actually miss the shit out of you
aweh vannie! i miss you too. college has been keeping me in my toes and i work on weekends.  i do miss you a lot.

i'm not dude

please tell me i'm not the only one who hears j michael tatum's voice when reading jumin's messages.
let's be honest, if mm was an anime and if there were to be an english dub of said anime, j michael tatum would probs get casted as jumin.
i was just thinking about this the other day he would 100% be jumin
yes! i knew i wasn't alone in thinking this!
and i feel like yoosung would sound a lot like whoever did the va for nagisa in free
definitely! i'm not sure who would voice seven though.
clifford chapin. he voiced hide from tokyo ghoul.
yes. he's perfect for seven.
right??? i can't quite figure out who zens va could be though?

trump's just announced that apple will start building factories and making phones in the us rather than asia if he wins. how?
trade deals / favorable tariffs. will be cost-effective to make in usa. if motorola could make moto x here why can't apple?
really? so a us govt handout to apple inc?
not sure what you mean. trade deals are a mess. i'm no expert but we should cater to ourselves first.
who would want a job in us that pays so little? or should the us govt subsidise them?
good question. look at all costs. make stuff here for free, no tax/shipping. low better than no wage. many unemployed (1/2)
(2/2)costof product maybe a lttl highr. companiesto innovate. effect oneconomy offset, longterm benefit. will findmore info
so its quite clear to me at least that its undeliverable. parts aren't american in any case.
part of it is certainly campaign rhetoric, for sure. lemme look at some stuff today. maybe i can find something informative

i was recently asked by doc to take alexithymia test. think i scored 100%. no wonder i have such people problems, emotionally.
i hear you! i pretty much have to be in an intense emotional state to recognise what's going on, by then it's usually too late!
i'd have to be in extreme intense emotional state. rarely happens.
i wish i could say it rarely happens to me! but seems to be easing lately which is good 
actually i think other people blow up. i rarely notice things i should and then people get mad at me. i'm learning...
how are things going at home btw?
better, trying to work stuff out. i think my emotional detachment really did some damage.
i'm glad for you and your family! no doubt, but alexithymia is a legitimate explanation of that, which you've not long known 
she felt like it was a "life sentence."



had a good time at worship night with my love
are you going to atlanta in january??
they told me about it but idk

all i want is to continue representing indigent clients accused of crimes. why is this so fucking hard.
do immigration work. it pays and you help people who really need it.
i've thought about it but there's not a big industry here
where is the closest immigration court? and why industry? we rep people not industries. mostly asylum, etc. tough work though.
i mean we have local firms here but they aren't hiring
don't you work for yourself?!
i do and i love it but there's not enough work to keep me afloat
which is why i suggested adding immigration to the mix. in your own firm.
i do really like this idea



i'd like my 28 dollars back
coulda hit me up i'm good at that shit
fuck really i want to die idk if it's just fucked bc of the maker or bc o built it wrong :/

you can name your dumb kid alfred or edward but i can't name mine thelbert, rdwulf, or angeltheow? anglo-saxon double standards suck!
my second is actually edmund which is like halfway there.
edmund is a good name. lot of good edmunds
hillary. i dig burke. the bastard.
big fan of edmund, the earl of rutland who died in like i don't know 1458 or something
wasn't he a big ol jerk who was set to be king but then got himself killed in battle? cause a lotta edmunds are like that.
he was cool but yeah he did get killed in battle. and his brothers were both kings, so maybe he would have gotten around to it
no i'm thinking of some other wars of the roses edmund, not beaufort or tudor will come to me.
i love england back when there were only four names to choose from



i said i wasn't going to do a morning mention again cause people don't really do what the mention actually says lol

jim brown was at the forefront and did so much for athletes of color with muhammad ali, bill russell, and kareem.... but tonight? idk man
he was on some other stuff. made me kind of upset knowing he has a platform and decided to speak bs.
let's not get it twisted, jim has definitely used his platform in a major way at a worse time, but tonight i didn't approve
well tonight is exactly what i'm speaking on...tonight he was taking the side of the oppressor so i could care less
"taking the side" might be a reach lol but he definitely made it seem like because he had one good cop friend it's not bad cops
a reach? nah he clearly said the police are not at fault but black people are. not a reach to me
he never said black people are at fault lol i understand why you would feel that way. the indirect answers are the worst
who he say was at fault after saying police weren't ?
look at my last tweets. you'll see what he did. lol.
a town stomped?oh wow lol



don't even get me started on marie osmond getting 3rd.
worst freestyle ever but then again what do you expect from the worst pro ever?
i kinda enjoyed her at first like i was ok with her passing josie, albert, and wayne but after that she should've gone
all i know is her freestyle so that's what i'm going off of oops 
she was actually a lot better than that freestyle showed..... not finals worthy though like maybe 7th at best
i wouldn't doubt it. i kinda quit binge watching at s4 because i couldn't find a stream for it
look up her quicksteps sometime she got a 28 on one of them and 29 on the other. idk why she excelled at that dance but she did
i really wanna watch season 5 in full.
it's one of my fav seasons i think
mine is 19 atm



love jesus first. jesus would never condone a man like trump, you know this.
or hilliary commits murder with her killing babies in 3 trimester she said it with her own mouth and yes i'm 72 on ss welfar

someone just told me that being a spurs fan coexists with my personality lmaooo 
lmfao that tells me everything about you
 i don't know if i'm offended or happy. what does that mean lmao
i mean the spurs got rings so it can't be too bad 
y'all are insulting me on the low lol that's fine
you don't even believe that but ighhhhttt you got ittt 
yes i do, that emoji on the end is shade lol
how about this then 
too late 
i said what i said and in that order 



players like simmons and leonard are tough...pushes back against the soft label the spurs have
all facts, but i've never heard that rhetoric in regards to the spurs.
"too many europeans", not enough dog in them, blah blah been a off and on critique of the team for a while in hoop circles
i guess i've heard those opinions tossed around. never really equated it to them being soft though, but i feel you.
europeans always accused of that...kg himself would target euro players for being soft
true. i thought pop, david &amp; duncan were enough to disregard that label. they're "boring" if u don't know , soft is crazy tho.
they were boring when they had a slow pace with lots of post ups. lost to the suns and they switched it up. pops the greatest
yeah you can't really deny greatness after a resume like pop's.
gets this gold in 2020 it's a wrap
another ring without timmy would do more for his resume &amp; he'll probably get that if he keeps coaching another 5-7 years.



i have been up since 430 just tossing &amp; turning
this exam is going to kill me
that makes two of us! i just went through your snapchat thinking damn dedication!!
i seriously going to cry. i didn't know it was today til i went to my lab last night.
now that sucks, i knew about it, just did not have time to really sit down &amp; study. we will have to get together to study
true omg. i worked 6 days a week i didn't have time either way. ugh next exam we are cramming together dude.
girl me too! we will definitely do so in like 2 week advance 
true. i'm so scared to fail this dude
no seriously, thankfully he throws one exam away 
yeah i need my last exam thrown away

quija got me fucked up!

"jordan doesn't like anyone, he only tolerates us because he works with us".".
that's not true. you loved rodney.
the only thing i loved about rodney was his aid in developing the mcdonald's theory, regarding dating optimization.
"honey dip"
this rings no bells.
that's what you said when you spoke in his voice. or something similar. but i probably got it wrong, like everything
oh shit, i forgot about the rodney impression! i think it was something about doing whippits in the parking lot
it was! and something what he called his girls. but i don't recall that. it def. was about whip its though. still funny.
i only remember the whippits bit, and the classic "yeeainneeknow"
the rodney impression, along with the phil impressions where easily my favorite macedonia moments.



support a corrupt warmongering evil woman like hillary?
because she's not and you've been misled?
uhm.... how would that be?
i refer you to your original comment.
have you not seen the o'keefe videos and loads of wikileaks?
o'keefe? that's a riot. he specializes in getting low level staffers to mouth off, then edits them to make wild claims.
dude; did or did you not watch the videos?
yes. and if you can tell me how edited claims of a low level wisconsin staffer make clinton evil, feel free.
ps why where creamer and fogel fired if the videos where edited?
because the were low-level staffers making statements way above their paygrade.



happy birthday babe!!

i need more info on people's definition of the word "rigged." do you mean literal vote-tampering, or a system of self-perpetuating power?
like are you saying there's an actual conspiracy here, or are you just it takes money and power to get political influence?
and if the latter, is this idea new to you?
when trump says "the election is rigged" to the media, he means "it's a biased system favoring entrenched politico".
i'm also curious how this compares with sanders supporters' complaints of a rigged economic system &amp; primary.
to those complaints, my response alternates between "no it's not" and "of course it is. you're just figuring that out?"
as a career public servant, it is often troubling to see experience and dedication to the public cause turned against someone.
i'm far more disturbed by the role of money in politics than the role of "insider influence."
you can relax about the influence of money in politics - it has only been an issue since the roman republic (509-27bc).
longstanding problems can still be disturbing problems.

checking amtrak tickets for blfc cabin, bed, private, bathroom, shower evetything $3400 4 days. flight 6 hours 400 round trip xd
*everything. that includes three meals a day with package. takes 4 days from my house. beautiful trip, love it but alone :(  
except for the solitude, seems like the trip one can dream of =)
it goes all across country and through rocky mountains. if anyone goes i will be happy to go too. hate alone trips.
sounds like a blast, but an excursion like that is out of my budget for the time being =(
someday*
with hard work, i'll join you one day for a retreat to remember, no slacking for me ^^
i would love to get a bunch of us together for a ride to blfc. #memories
would love to do that, and i'm sure we could find others =)
oh yes, i am sure we could. split cost makes.it more fun.  you could get three to a room easy 4 in family room
i'm sure we can talk at more length about it soon... if we split it 4 ways, i think we may be able to handle the expense =)

hhsur pep rally's ain't shitur student section ain't shitur sports ain't shit do u even have spirit days besides botb ? i'm curious .
okay stop  thats wrong
your football team wins sometimes .. the only thing worth being acknowledged is your basketball,wrestling, and water polo
every sport at hemet is better then wv ?
ya'll act like we ain't shit because our football team is the best .. but neither is yours lmao
like i said there is no sport at west valley better then hemet high . 
actually our water polo and swim are very successful along with our softball/baseball, and our volleyball teams ...
okay first your volleyball is no where close better then ours and baseball we won cif like a year ago 
we deserve just as much respect as ya'll do our players work hard in every sport just like yours do correct ?
nope cause if y'all did y'all would win 
welp i'm sorry but we will continue to respect and love our school along w showing nothing but support to our players



if you think about it, what's absent from the wikileaks emails is at least as intriguing as what's in them.
please go on, ron.
well, there's little or no substantive discussion of her health - neither confirming the spin of her camp or otherwise.
there's also very little about bill clinton, from what i've seen.
given the seeming candor if not recklessness of the stuff we have seen, there's a remarkable absence of emails about policy
it's almost as if this is a head fake - a calculated release of embarrassing but unfortunately not really damning or &gt;
or criminal material and a studied absence of discussion about key issues, people and problems - complete with a media &gt;
and "expert" buy-in of this "russian hack" cover story to assure "authenticity" and imply completeness - yet virtually no &gt;
attempt to explain or deny the emails' authenticity. remarkably little. since when is the dnc shy about lying?
it's as if these were released to give the impression that we really have the whole story now and it's not that awful.
again, that observation arises from the gaps in subject matter, the lack of denials and the evident ease of the "hacks."
i'm starting to wonder who's really being played here and how. #wikileaks



wanna get my nose pierced so bad but i'm scared lol.
it's just a quick pinch ! i've had mine done 6 times lmao
i'm just a little pussy when it comes to piercings lol.

when i was in 8th grade i sneezed during the plege of allegiance and my homeroom teacher made me stand in the hallway for the rest of class
omg who was it
hoos
i knew it was either her or carey lol
when my mom told her i got five "5s" on ap tests she said "i wish i saw that kind of performance out of him when i taught him"
(that's 5 fives in 1 year, i got seven 5s total if i remember correctly)
her and carey were the most cruel miserable teachers i ever met
he might have been before your time but ap euro "silva" hated me just as much, i think because i had long hair
mr carey used to squirt me with a water gun when i fell asleep in class +say creepy shit so i put sand in his waterbottle
i usually think teachers should be treated better and stuff but hes a perverted piece of shit so idc
i tutored a girl in his class like 3 years ago and he is lazy as hell at least in his curriculum
he didnt know why planets were round i had to correct him

ohh damn. that's too much for me. i'd sleep on the floor

kick them out 
i can't  i love them way too much n they always get me w their puppy eyes 
that's why they do it. cause they know you won't kick them out. they have the power 
i'm like their bitch now huh 



so according to what i've seen, chad will not be on again until thursday. wtf??? #days
i'm fine with it. don't want to see anymore scenes with him &amp; gabi. the fewer the better.
i like chad and gabi as friends. i have no problem with it.
that's fine. i find them boring and shoved down our throats &amp; i see more than friends. jmo.
i love the scenes with chad and ari! i think they're adorable!
but he's not a father figure for her. sonny and jj should be having more scenes with her than chad.
it kind of seems to me like ari thinks of j.j as mommy's friend. she's too young to understand anything more than that.
it doesn't matter what ari thinks. we should see the bonding they  (gabi) talk about with j.j. and ari.
it seems to me like gabi's trying to make j.j and ari seem closer than they actually are.
i have no reason to not believe her. after all they have been together for a year. they should be close. -more than chad &amp; ari
j.j's only been a part of ari's life for a brief time.
i mean chad hasn't really been a part of ari's life since she was born. that's a stretch imo.



if he isn't obsessed with me , ion want him 

wassup hollywood 
like i'm pretty sure i texted yu multiple and i didn't get a response

damn that's crazy as hell! how do you like it out there?
honestly it's one of the best moves i've made. it's so fun being an hour away from nyc! it's a lot like portland in ways
i bet! i'm lowkey jealous. i love nyc. i think i'm moving to california tho.
see i was going to go back to california, but philly weirdly worked out better for me haha where abouts in california???
you all alone out there? or you got family? i got family in buena park near la, so that's where i'll be.
ugh i was gonna go back to la!!! no i have my best friend from disney here (thank god) she flew to pdx&amp;we drove back here!
that's dope, i want to come out there in the next few years my self! maybe i'll come visit! yeah i love la tho. 
do it!!! i love it because of all the history and stuff, but if you like portland, you'll like philly for sure!!



i'm a texan, going for a blue state. i miss ann richards. you can see my photo of her on my fb page, connie rose malone.
i love gov. ann richards and i miss her!
i knew liz carpenter. if you look at that photo, ann was leaning down and talking to liz carpenter. i wrote an article, 2.
wow! very nice!!!
ann was a travis county commissioner ...my county, before she was gov.
when ann ran for state treasurer, i worked on her campaign.
that's great! i worked on hillary's senate campaign.
wow!
nice to meet you.  i'm so excited and can't wait until 11-8.
me, too! i hope it works out. i know that it's going to be hard for her to serve because she won't be respected by some.
hillary works well with everyone.  she's going to surprise a lot of people.
i heard that she was liked in congress.
yes, that's true! very well liked.

when you're least expecting it obviously
for my birthday
would it then be my birthday too?
no
then i'm not interested



haven't we just come to accept tyrod being a game manager? knowing he doesn't really have any of his weapons
is it really fair to cast judgement on some of these passes that he's making at this point because he doesn't have
many options
you just want to see him make plays with what he has. but he hasn't. it's troubling
well what does he really have man his 2 best targets are out and shady is hurt and if anything is troubling it's clay not
getting the ball
they're open.
make a play with his feet
some times a break down though, just asks for a qb to navigate the pocket, slide and find a new platform to throw.
line wasn't helping him much on sunday
give my film study a peak when it comes out this morning, you'll see what i'm talking about.
if you can throw me a link later on i'll check it out cuz i don't have the all 22 and i'm looking forward to seeing this
you got it



poor kate has been through the ringer. hope she is okay #fromdusktilldawn
i know right? i just wish she'd get the chance to kick butt. she's always getting hurt.
yeah. really hope she is saved next week
they can't kill kate. i already lost burt.
yeah. that sucked
i loved burt. couldn't they have switched his fate with sex machine?? burt was so cool!!!
yeah i agree. hilarious that so many wants sm dead 
before you added the weed to him. lol.
he was a huge asset to the team. burt will be missed
yes he will. he and amaru stole the show this season.
madison has been amazing as amaru this season. definitely an emerging favorite of mine
you can tell she's got a great career ahead of her.
yeah she does. hope she stays till the end of series though



really not sure what to expect from miami heat this season
hopefully the 7th or 8th seed in the east
i could see 6th or maybe even 5th if everyone plays up to par and to the potential and it all starts with whiteside
idk eastern confrence has gotten way better, idk what to make of the heat's roster
it's a thinker of a situation but heat's roster is a ok one i'd say so ehhh idk
whiteside, haslem, dragic, winslow, richardson, and waitors are solid but idk what to make of the rest of the team
if those specific players can stay healthy and not be dumb and get suspensions or anything then miami could be decent i'd say
like i said hopefully 7th or 8th seed. knowing pat riley he is already planing for free agency 2017
nobody ever knows what riley gonna do, how he gonna shock us like he be doing but i agree with a 6,7 seed
the key to the season is seeing how whiteside handles being the star and how winslow &amp; richardson develop in their second year
exactly and we all know how whiteside's emotions can get the better of him oh man &amp; also i'm very hopefully of richardson
and hopefuly chris bosh can come back and play at some point this season. also i forgot about tyler johnson he can ball too
tyler johnson yes he good lowkey and it's an unknown situation for bosh, hopefully he can but i don't want him to risk it



not confident about tonight. think chelsea might steamroll us.
we have an outside chance but it's tough. a lot depends on how seriously conte is taking the competition.least we're improving
they have no europe so i'd imagine it'll be a strong team from them. hopefully it's a good game!
good point. hopefully! i'd love a cup run but honestly be pleased enough with a good performance and close game
this cup is quite short as well! 2 more wins and we're in the semi's!
yeah it's brilliant but don't wanna get ahead of myself with a tie like this!
definitely not. hopefully we get the job done. i'd take a nice win on pens! not sure my heart could handle it though!! 
odds on dimi to score a direct fk or solo run? or another lanzini v chelsea banger 
i'd be happy with any of the above!! i'd take a goal going in off zaza's backside!
i'd take an impossible goal from enner out in liverpool
i'd forgot all about enner until you mentioned him!  wonder how he's getting on?!
other than running away from police while playing for ecuador, so as not to pay child support, sitting on the everton bench :p
ah, good ol' enner. shame he can't play this weekend, reckon we might have a good chance of winning!!
not a good chance, 100% chance!

ewwww what ratchet would roll their eyes?
a boy that needs an ass whoopin from his mama. just 1 of 5 of my usual problem kids. it's like everyday his brain is reset.
ewww the sass at such a young age
seriously. note to parents: slap ya motha fcuken kids.
haha srsly. but you dealing with them hood rat kids tho
their parents were probably og hoodrats who shouldn't have reproduced.
yeah the kinda 16 and pregnant and goes out every night leaving their kid at home with the gparents
then when they actually take care of their kid, they feel they deserve an award for doing what they did...be a parent 
foreals!!! like "took my kid out for lunch"  bruhhh i can't even deal i know so many
"fed my kid breakfast, dropped him off to school, when's my 'me time?'" ha!
haha "it's hard being a parent" nigga you only babysat your own kid for 2 hours 
"shoulda pulled out" lol  parents need slaps themselves.
seriously! or wrap up if they can't take on responsibility



could chapter 3 setting be 1985?
can you tell your evidence or assumptions for ch3 existence please ?
if iam not mistaken chap 1 and 2 are in 1984. with hideo doing glasses that are 1985 as a hint.
well, the plot ended at 1995 outer heaven where venom was killed there !
well there is a big gap in 1984 and 1995. he haven't got the rest of the story just yet.
what else do you expect other than disarmament scene/s ?
that is will unlock chapter 3,4,5
does these chapters include more scenes ? because nothing else showed up with datamining
of course from i get out of the fox engine. the code changes with each step. it makes its scenes in real time.
you mean there's coding for specific actions and voice acting but without video files ?!
speaking of data mine has anyone got a copy and not played it at all and data mine it?
don't know. what's the point of doing so ?
if so you probably only see chapter 1 i am guessing. hideo did in fact said he was scared noone would finish the game.
a game with a storyline only to be experienced by finishing an almost impossible online quest! let's wait and see.
i just hope we will see it soon. that could be way hideo is sad.

if any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. (1 cor. 3:18) #atheism #bible #god
yes your religion's hatred for intelligence, which sees right through it, is well known.
starting out the day being that judgmental can't be good friend.
says the judgemental one who views others as fools.
i haven't judged you. i quoted scripture. what happened was you read it and judged yourself. that's how the holy spirit works
nope, you judge others by the self serving words of your book.
self-serving? i'm trying to save you from eternal torment bud. and taking a torrent of abuse for it. get over yourself
"i'm right, anyone who disagrees with me is wrong and a fool." yeah doesn't get much more self serving.
this is not about me. it's about you, because you know in your heart that what i'm saying is true
you just proved it's all about your need to be right by claiming to know i know you're right.
you have been given the knowledge of god. you have no excuse
claiming to know that i know you're right is arrogance of the highest order. shame on you.
actually i'm referring to what the scriptures say. just doing my job and warning you that hell is real. #jesuschrist will save you
how you claim to know my mind is irrelevant, that you claim to is the point and shows breathtaking arrogance.
i know the scripture, which says that god knows your heart and mind, and the truth has been written there
not to mention, what a pathetically transparent "don't worry your head about why they don't believe" argument.
i'm not trying to convince you of anything, just laying it out for you. your response is entirely up to you

fun w/numbers on six flags q3 press release: a tweetstorm
six flags income dropped 24% in q3 b/c of compensation to executives for their likely success of "project 600" ($600m in adj ebitda by '17)
in order to achieve this goal, sf would need to grow ebitda by just under 14% from '15-17. this would be considered "aggressive"
problems: guest spending is trending down over the year, with per cap spend 1% lower in q3 than q3 2015 and up for year by less than 1%
q3 revenue was also down in peak months by 3% and ebitda was down roughly the same amount. earnings per share down 34%
six flags will indicate that expansion of holiday event should bring in new revenue, but trend of per cap spending drops shouldnt be ignored
very real possibility that their business plan is beginning to hit a wall. expanding season passholder base has natural limits.
also addition of events has potential dilution effect wherein lieu of expanding attendance numbers, same amount just disperse over calendar
this means that while you still have to staff the parks for peak periods in summer, there are fewer guests generally arriving on off days
instead, they just show up later in the year.
tl;dr version: six flags growth is slowing/mb dunzo and may miss their projections but execs paid themselves like they would hit it anyways
enough, what about skittles
still not as good as m&amp;ms but both contain blue 1 which can cross the blood brain barrier and may cause neurocognitive probs
yeah that's the good stuff baby
if im gonna dement its gonna be because i enjoyed good ass m&amp;ms
m&amp;ms aren't in the skittles class of artificial fruit though, also mars/hershey chocolate is objectively low rent
what is the pinnacle of artificial fruit? this is a debate i am for atm
well i would say skittles but also starburst are up there
i feel as though starburst via sheer size advantage are the more immersive fruit experience
they are so... juicy
yah otoh now and later should be destroyed and sent to hell
